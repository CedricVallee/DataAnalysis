Results of Operations

     During the past three years the Company has shifted its efforts
away from holding of uranium properties, because of the continuing
low level of uranium spot market prices, to a newly developing market
of byproduct material disposal.  It is the Company's intent to make
the byproduct disposal business its primary business segment through
1995 after which it does not expect to be permitted by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to continue to accept byproduct material for
disposal. 

     During the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the seven-
months ended December 31, 1991 the Company entered the business of
uranium byproduct material disposal and received $323,000, $319,000
and $120,000 respectively for performing on five contracts for
disposal of uranium byproduct material at its mill site.  It
continues to seek other such disposal contracts.  During September
1993 the Company entered into a marketing agreement with American
Ecology Corporation (AEC) by which AEC would assist the Company in
obtaining byproduct disposal contracts for the disposal of 10,000
cubic yards of material.  AEC made a $202,500 advance payment to the
Company which will be recovered by it either through one-half of net
disposal revenue or the issuance of the Company's common stock.  The
Company will retain 50% of the net profits generated from disposal
revenue.
  
     General and administrative expenses decreased approximately 25
percent during the year ended December 31, 1993 compared to 1992 due
to the 1992 expenditures associated with preparing a confidential
private placement memorandum that was circulated starting in January
1993.  During 1992 the general and administrative expenses increased
approximately eight percent on an annualized basis compared to the
seven month period ended December 31, 1991 due to establishment of a
money purchase pension plan for its employees and expenditures
associated with preparing the private placement memorandum.  During
the seven-month period ended December 31, 1991 general and
administrative expenses increased 46 percent on an annualized basis
compared to the fiscal year ended May 31, 1991 due to an increased
level of activity, primarily costs to obtain a license amendment for
receipt of byproduct material and relocation costs associated with a
newly appointed president.  General and administrative expenses for
the year ended May 31, 1991 increased by 72 percent compared to the
prior year.  This sharp increase was primarily the result of
additional expense associated with a change in management of the
Company consisting of a new board of directors and the new president. 
The additional expenses included a premium for a new director and
officer liability insurance policy (approximately $40,000) and
severance pay for two former officers (approximately $70,000).

     Byproduct material disposal expenses of $29,000, $32,000 and
$29,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the seven-
months ended December 31, 1991 consisted of labor, rental costs and
lease payments of earth moving equipment.

     In December 1993, the Company determined that its decision to
sell its primary mineral properties rather that hold the properties
for future potential development required greater consideration be
given to in-ground market values and the Company's present financial
position.  The Company determined its range of potential loss for the
mineral properties to be from approximately $3 million to
approximately $7 million.  Because of the Company's continuing
process to solicit bids for its mineral properties, the lack of an
active market for in-ground uranium reserves, and uncertainties as to
the ultimate intent of the major shareholder, management is unable to
determine at this time whether any amount in that range provides a
better estimate than any other amount.  Therefore, in accordance with
the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
(Statement) 5, Accounting for Contingencies, a $3 million mineral
property impairment was recognized during 1993 which represents a 31%
reduction in the mineral property valuation at December 31, 1993.

     In December 1991, after consideration of uranium market
conditions and a recent sale by a third party of a comparable uranium
property, management determined that a $3.2 million write-down in the
carrying value of the Company's uranium properties was warranted. 
The asset value shown on the balance sheet for December 31, 1991 was
reduced by that amount.  Write downs were not warranted during the
year ended December 31, 1992.

     Abandonment of property interests occurred during the year ended
December 31, 1993 in the amount of $544,000 and during the seven-
month period ended December 31, 1991 in the amount of $115,000.  
There were no property abandonments during the year ended December
31, 1992 or the fiscal year ended May 31, 1991.  The Company's policy
is to abandon identified mineral properties once it has been
determined that those properties have little or no economic value
based on apparent low levels of mineralization and the carrying costs
of the properties.  The evaluation is normally made based upon
results of exploration drilling intended to demonstrate whether the
properties contain enough mineralization to warrant further
expenditures.  The abandonments during 1993 represented approximately
54% of the Company's mineral acreage.  Approximately five percent of
the Company's carrying value of its mineral properties were expensed
during 1993.

     Interest income continued to decline for the year ended December
31, 1993, as it did in all annualized periods presented.  The
decreases in interest income are attributable to decreases in
interest rates paid on the Company's reclamation fund and decreases
in the Company's reclamation bond escrow accounts, the principal
source of this income, as funds were withdrawn to apply to the cost
of completed reclamation work.  

     Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 was
$186,000 as compared to interest expense of $123,000, $36,000, and
$47,000 for the year ended December 31, 1992, for the seven months
ended December 31, 1991 and the fiscal year ended May 31, 1991. 
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 increased 51%
as compared with the year ended December 31, 1992.  This increase in
interest expense for the past two periods reported is primarily
attributable to the increase in average outstanding debt resulting
from increases in amounts borrowed from Cycle Resource Investment
Corporation to fund operations, particularly the costs of preparing

for a commercial byproduct disposal license and the installation of
new management.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's working capital deficit at December 31, 1993 was
$2,200,000 while at December 31, 1992 it was $1,590,000, at December
31, 1991 it was $739,000, and at May 31, 1991 it was $306,000.  The
increased working capital deficits at December 31, 1993, 1992 and
1991 are primarily due to the negative cash flow from operations. 

     The Company does not have any commitments for funding, and owes
$2,031,200 in notes due on June 30, 1994 to CRIC.  The Company has no
other credit arrangements.  Previous efforts to obtain funding
included the preparation of a confidential private placement
memorandum by which a California based financier began offering in
January 1993 $5 million to $8 million of ANC common stock to
potential foreign investors at $1.05 per share.  This offering failed
during the summer of 1993, and the Company was forced to abandon its
efforts towards developing a commercial disposal facility. 
Consequently, the Company terminated its employment agreement with
its previous president and must liquidate some or all of its mineral
properties in order to repay its debt obligations and to provide the
necessary working capital to continue operations and satisfy its
reclamation obligations.

     In prior years, the Company had relied upon investment income
from the reclamation bond, release of funds from the reclamation bond
as a result of reductions in the bonding requirement and short-term
borrowings from stockholders to satisfy its working capital needs. 
However, during the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the
seven-months ended December 31, 1991, the Company has received a
portion of its cash flow from disposal of third party byproduct
material.  In order to expedite the September 1991 amendment to the
Company's mill site reclamation plan by which the Company was
permitted by the NRC to accept byproduct material, the Company agreed
to allow the interest earned on approximately $1.9 million of the
reclamation bond to accumulate and increase the bond fund until the
disposal space initially authorized is exhausted.  The amount of
interest accumulation to the bond fund is estimated at $150,000
during 1994 and 1995.

     Anticipated revenues from the American Ecology Corporation (AEC)
agreement and the Company's 50% share of the net income derived from
the disposal of third party byproduct material are expected to
provide the Company's day to day working capital needs for the near
future.  AEC did not make the $202,500 prepayment expected in
February 1994 because the NRC did not issue its policy allowing for
the co-disposal of byproduct material and like-kind material but
instead will rule on such applications on an individual basis. 
Therefore, in accordance with the AEC agreement, AEC can either
exchange its first $202,500 payment for ANC common stock at market
value or renegotiate the agreement.  AEC has indicated that its
intent is to renegotiate the terms of the September 1993 agreement.

     On August 24, 1993, the Company reached an agreement with Cycle
Resource Investment Corporation (CRIC), a stockholder, for CRIC to
increase its total loans to $2,031,200.  The Company was not able to
repay the notes on August 31, 1993 when due.  On January 20, 1994
this $2,031,200 debt plus approximately $143,000 in accrued interest 
was extended to June 30, 1994.  CRIC holds a mortgage constituting a
first lien on the Company's Peach properties which represent
substantially all the values of the uranium properties.  Beginning in
May 1994, the Company's anticipated byproduct disposal revenues,
which it bases upon its internal analysis of the market and its
recent activities, are expected to provide a significant portion of
the 1994 working capital requirements if the CRIC debt obligations
are deferred.  The Company's ability to continue in operation during
1994 depends upon completion of a sale of its mineral properties,
realizing revenues from its byproduct disposal business or increased
borrowings and continued deferments of its notes due CRIC.  It is
unlikely that any additional loans can be obtained.  There are no
assurances that byproduct disposal revenues will be realized, that a 
sale of the uranium properties will be achieved, that the sales price
or terms will be adequate to meet the Company's needs in either the
short term or the long term, and consequently no assurances that the
Company can remain in business.  When the Company's reclamation site
is closed to the receipt of additional byproduct material, which is
expected at the end of 1995, and after the Company has sold its
uranium properties which is expected during 1994, it will have
essentially no remaining assets unless the uranium properties sell
for more than the amount of the Company's indebtedness, as to which
there are no assurances.   

     The Company estimates its reclamation costs for the Gas Hills
project to be $2,740,290 at December 31, 1993.  The NRC has required
the Company to maintain a bond in the amount of $3,063,371 to assure
completion of  future reclamation.  The bond fund has increased to
$3,175,470 as of December 31, 1993.  The bond consists of liquid
investments, a surety bond for $865,000, a $25,000 letter of credit,
and certificates of deposit.  The excess funds, if any, will be
returned to the Company upon satisfactory completion of the
reclamation project.
