*Remuneration:  Average of the highest five consecutive years of
"Covered Compensation" out of the final ten years of service.
 
 "Covered Compensation" means "W-2 earnings" or "base
earnings", if greater, as defined in the Pension Plan.  W-2
earnings for pension purposes consist of salary (including 401(k)
and Section 125 Plan contributions but not deferrals under a non-
qualified Deferred Compensation Plan), bonus and taxable income
attributable to restricted stock awards.  Salary and bonus amounts
for the named Executive Officers for 1993 are as shown on the

                                Page 19


 

Summary Compensation Table.  Compensation deferred under the
Corporation's non-qualified deferred compensation plan is included
in Covered Compensation here because it is covered by the
Corporation's unfunded supplemental employees' retirement plan
for the participants in that plan.
 
  Current Compensation covered by the Pension Plan for any
named executive whose Covered Compensation differs by more than
10% from the compensation disclosed for that executive in the
Summary Compensation Table:  Mr. Kaman, $927,075; Mr. Levenson,
$679,669.
         
  Federal law imposes certain limitations on annual pension
benefits under the Pension Plan.  For the named executive officers,
the excess will be paid under the Corporation's unfunded
supplemental retirement plan.
 
  The Executive Officers named in Item 11(b) are participants
in the plan and as of January 1, 1994, had the number of years of
credited service indicated:  Mr. Kaman - 48 years; Mr. Levenson -
11 years; Mr. Kozlow - 34 years; Mr. Renehan - 10 years; and Mr.
Smith - 34 years.
 
  Benefits are computed generally in accordance with the
benefit formula described above.
 
G)   Compensation of Directors.  Non-officer members of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation receive an annual retainer of
$14,000 and a fee of $750 for attending each meeting of the Board
and each meeting of a Committee of the Board, except that the
Chairman of the Audit Committee receives $850 for attending each
meeting of that Committee.  These fees may be received on a
deferred basis.
 
H)  Employment Contracts and Termination, Severance and Change of
Control Arrangements.  The Corporation has no employment
contract, plan or arrangement with respect to any named executive
which relates to employment termination for any reason, including
resignation, retirement or otherwise (except as described in
connection with the Corporation's Pension Plan and the Corporation's 
non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan), or a change in
control of the Corporation or a change in any such executive
officer's responsibilities following a change of control, which
exceeds or could exceed $100,000.
