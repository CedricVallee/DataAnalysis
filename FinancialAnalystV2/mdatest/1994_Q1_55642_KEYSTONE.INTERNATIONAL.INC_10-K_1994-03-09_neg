RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)
 
  Net Sales
 
     Net sales decreased 2% in 1993 compared with a 2% increase in 1992. Shown
below is an analysis of net sales. The translation effect of weakening foreign
currencies had a significant impact in 1993 on the results of international
operations.

     The Company's sales and results of operations outside the United States are
subject to the inherent risk of fluctuations in currency rates. During 1993, a
basket of European currencies weakened in relation to the U.S. dollar by
approximately 12%, which impacted the U.S. dollar results of the Company's
European operations. Further weakening may occur in 1994. Keystone's European
operations represent about 29% of the Company's consolidated sales.
 
  Costs and Expenses
 
     Cost of sales as a percentage of sales were 57.4%, 56.7% and 57.4% in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of
sales in 1993 compared to 1992 was due to lower margins earned in Europe where
the Company is experiencing increased price competition. In 1992, the
improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales compared to 1991 was
primarily due to improvements in gross margins at the two Italian companies
acquired in 1989 and a decrease in lower margin project-oriented business,
reflective of more selective sales order activity.
 
     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1% and 2% in 1993
and 1992, respectively. The increases are primarily attributable to costs
related to increased sales volume primarily in the Asia-Pacific region,
partially offset by the translation effect of weakening foreign currencies. The
Company's ongoing program to maintain tight controls over selling, general and
administrative expenses has resulted in maintaining the amount as a percentage
of sales in the 28% range. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses were 28.9%, 28.1% and 27.9% in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.
 
     Restructuring and merger expenses in 1991 of $22,372 represent $19,993
accrued for operational restructuring primarily in the United States and Europe
as well as $2,379 of expenses associated with the merger and rationalization of
operations of Kunkle Industries, Inc. The Company's restructuring actions focus
on strengthening its capabilities as a low-cost provider of quality flow control
products and systems worldwide.
 
     During 1993, the majority of the remaining restructuring and merger
provision was utilized. Major restructuring and merger activities during 1993
related to the completion of the Houston, Texas-based product rationalization
and relocation in which a facility was acquired in Guadalajara, Mexico and
refurbished to accommodate the Company's manufacturing requirements. As part of
this relocation, several small product lines were moved from Houston to this
lower-cost facility. Other activities during the year included the consolidation
of certain facilities primarily in European locations. The Company believes the
remaining restructuring reserves, which are expected to be utilized during 1994,
are sufficient to cover the restructuring projects which are still in process.
 
     Other expense includes amortization of intangible assets and debt costs as
well as exchange gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. In 1992, other expense also included a reserve of $2,000 for
management's estimate of potential environmental exposure at one of the
Company's inoperative facilities. Management still believes this reserve is
adequate and potential exposure will not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial position or future results of operations.
 
     The Company's effective income tax rate was 37%, 39% and 47% in 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively. The Company records taxes on all unremitted foreign
earnings at a rate not less than the U.S. statutory rate. The primary components
of the difference between the domestic statutory tax rate and the actual
effective tax rate is caused by net operating losses of certain foreign entities
not currently realizable for tax purposes and foreign taxes in excess of the
U.S. statutory rate. The effective tax rate in 1993 includes the remeasurement
of deferred tax assets at the current U.S. statutory rate in accordance with the
new accounting standard for income taxes. See Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.
 
     The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its examination of the
Company's federal income tax returns for the years 1986 through 1988 and the
Company has received an assessment of additional tax. Most issues have been
resolved for these years, and the Company is vigorously pursuing administrative
remedies for the remaining issues. In addition, the IRS is currently examining
the federal income tax returns filed by the Company for the years 1989 and 1990.
Management believes that any adjustment that may result
 
                                        5
   8
 
from these examinations will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's
consolidated financial position or future results of operations.
 
     The 1993 cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $1,879
represents a credit relating to the adoption of the new accounting standard for
income taxes. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this Report for additional information. In 1991 the cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle of $4,928 (net of $2,539 in income taxes) represents a
charge relating to the adoption of the accounting standard for postretirement
benefits other than pensions. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)
 
     The Company's financial position remained strong during 1993. At December
31, 1993, the Company had working capital of $171,827 compared to $120,602 at
December 31, 1992. During 1993, the Company incurred capital expenditures of
$29,997 (net of proceeds from disposals) and paid cash dividends of $24,876.
Management is not aware of any potential impairments to the Company's liquidity,
and believes its internal and existing external sources of cash will provide the
necessary funds with which to meet its expected obligations. On November 1,
1993, the Company refinanced the $43,000 8.75% Notes with $45,000 6.34% Senior
Notes due November 1, 2000. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.
 
INFLATION
 
     During each year, inflation has had a relatively minor effect on the
majority of Keystone's operations. However, in Brazil, which accounted for only
1% of total net sales and net income in 1993, inflation often makes the
operating environment somewhat difficult. The 1993 translation losses reflected
on the Consolidated Statements of Income, included in Item 8 of this Report,
result from these operations. During 1991, the Company downsized its Brazilian
operations and reduced its assets exposed to devaluation. Beginning in 1992, the
Company determined that the economy and inflation rate in Mexico had stabilized
sufficiently to begin accounting for translation gains and losses as a separate
component of shareholders' investment consistent with the accounting treatment
of its other foreign subsidiaries.
