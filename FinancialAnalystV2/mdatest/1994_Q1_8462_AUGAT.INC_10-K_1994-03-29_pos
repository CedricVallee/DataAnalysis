Results of Operations

The Company continued to grow sales in 1993 over 1992 due to the significant
improvement in the domestic automotive markets and increased market penetration
in the cable television and telecommunications segments of the communications
industry.  The sales improvement in 1992 over 1991 was attributable to the
Company's expanded role in the worldwide automotive markets as well as
substantial sales growth in the Communications Products Business.  Sales in
1991 were affected in all major business units by the worldwide recession.
International sales were $89 million, $92 million and $79 million for the years
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Sales in 1991 included $28 million from
National Industries, Inc. acquired in August 1991.  See Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements which are included under Item 8
hereof.

The Interconnection Products Business sales remained flat for the three years
ended 1993 as the computer industry continued its lackluster performance.
Increases in new product sales have been offset by reduction in sales of mature
product lines and price reductions during this three year period.

Sales in the Wiring Systems and Components Business increased worldwide 21% in
1993 with domestic sales increasing 27% and international sales decreasing 22%
compared with 1992.  For 1992, domestic sales increased 88% and international
sales increased 14% when compared to 1991.

Worldwide sales in the Communication's Business increased 35% in 1993 over 1992
after increasing 17% in 1992 over 1991.  The division serves two primary
markets: cable television and telecommunications.  Both markets continued their
growth improvement in 1993 that started in 1992.  

                                                                            11

   14

Sales in 1993 continued its growth due to increased domestic volume in the
automotive business, improvement in worldwide communications sales offset
in part by a decline in international automotive sales.

Cost of products sold decreased by 1.2% of sales in 1993 as the Company
benefitted from its on-going cost control and productivity programs, increase
in new products offerings which were offset by selective selling price
decreases.  These costs increased by 1.6% of sales in 1992 compared to 1991 due
to the inclusion for a full year of National Industries which has higher labor
and material costs compared to the other business units.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) continued to decrease as a
percentage of sales in 1993.  This resulted from the leveraging of such
expenses due to increased volume, along with the Company's ongoing concerted
effort to maintain strong cost control in this area.  Management intends to
maintain SG&A expenses in the 16% to 18% range of sales.

In 1991, the Company reviewed the operations and asset base of the
Interconnection Products Business and it was determined that the recession has
shortened the life-cycle of some of the division's mature products resulting in
substantial excess manufacturing capacity.  Accordingly, this resulted in a $22
million restructuring charge against 1991 operating results.  The major
components of the charge include $18 million to close two manufacturing
facilities, discontinue selected mature product lines, consolidate two
administrative offices into one, and reduce administrative and management
personnel.  The 1991 restructuring program has been substantially completed in
1993.  Additionally, a $4 million reserve was provided for the write-down of
two unsold facilities.

Interest income decreased in 1993 and 1992 due to excess cash being reinvested
in the business units and lower investment rates compared to the prior year.
Interest expense decreased in 1993 due to reduction in long-term debt.  For
1992, interest expense increased substantially from 1991 due to the full year
impact of the $45 million debt incurred in September 1991 for the acquisition
of National Industries, Inc.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).  This change, as of that
date, did not have a significant impact on the financial statements.  Taxes in
1993 and 1992 were 33.9% and 32.5% of income, respectively, compared to the
statutory rate in 1993 and 1992 of 35% and 34%, respectively.  The loss
incurred in 1991 as a result of the restructuring was not tax benefitted due to
the lack of income earned in the jurisdictions where the charge was incurred.
The effective statutory rate for 1993 and 1992 was negatively impacted by taxes
imposed by various domestic operations and by higher taxes on international     
earnings where the Company operates.  These higher taxes were offset by the tax
benefit associated with the 1991 restructuring charge.  An income tax provision
of $.5 million was reported in 1991 due to income earned in various tax
jurisdictions.  See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
which are included under Item 8 hereof for the reconciliation of the provision
for income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company maintains sufficient liquidity and has the resources to fund its
operations under current business conditions.  The Company in 1993 amended its
revolving credit agreement with three banks by increasing its maximum borrowing
to $40 million.  As of December 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding
borrowings of $1 million under this credit facility.  During 1993, the Company
reduced its total debt by $14.2 million.  The Company's financial condition
improved in 1993 as working capital increased to $119 million compared to $107
million in 1992.  At year end 1993, long-term debt represented 22.7% of equity
compared with 31.4% for 1992.  Income generated from operations along with
established credit facilities is sufficient to cover expected growth in the
next few years.  Capital expenditures in 1994 are projected to be in the $20 to
22 million range.

The Company, in December 1991, suspended its quarterly common stock dividend in
order to maintain a strong balance sheet and to ensure Augat's financial
long-term objectives.  Management intends to reinstate a dividend when it is
feasible and prudent.

In December 1992, the Company was awarded a $40 million judgment as a result of
a lawsuit involving unfair trade practices.  The lawsuit is under appeal
and the eventual amount to be received is not determinable at this time.

The book value of the Company's common stock at December 31, 1993, was $10.60.
