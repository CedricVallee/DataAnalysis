ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

          Overview

             In 1993, the Company achieved record revenues, incurred the
          smallest loss ($11.1 million) before income taxes, minority
          interest and extraordinary item since the leveraged buy-out by
          its management and Employee Stock Ownership Plan in 1988, and
          ended the year with the largest backlog in its history.  In fact,
          but for losses in the  Commercial Services' aircraft maintenance
          business ($6.6 million), unusual write-offs and expenses in
          connection with two acquisitions ($3.6 million) and the above
          market PIK interest (approximately $4.1 million) the Company
          would have been profitable for the year.  However, the Company
          continues to be highly leveraged, and its debt expense continued
          to be excessive in comparison to its earnings and cash flow.
          Some of the major events in 1993 were:

             - Completed the acquisition of Technology Applications, Inc.
               and the purchase of certain net assets of Science Management
               Corporation's Information Division and NMI Systems, Inc.

             - Eliminated the Commercial Services Administrative Group,
               resulting in improved efficiencies and reduced general and
               administrative expenses.

             - Completed the relocation of the Miami, Florida aircraft
               maintenance operation to larger hanger facilities which will
               permit the Company to perform maintenance on wide-body
               aircraft.

             - Received the last payment from the ESOP on its $100 million
               loan from the Company.

             Revenues from the Department of Defense were $543 million in
          1993 compared to $538 million in 1992 and $523 million in 1991.
          These revenues represented 56.9% of total 1993 revenues compared
          to 59.0% in 1992 and 64.8% in 1991.  This represents the
          Company's third year of its strategic long range plan to continue
          to grow or maintain its defense business while focusing primarily
          on the growth of non-defense business.

          The following discussion of the Company's results of operations
          is directed toward the two major categories, Government Services
          and Commercial Services.

          Results of Operations

          Revenues  - Revenues for 1993 were $953.1 million compared to
          1992 revenues of $911.4 million, an increase of $41.7 million
          (4.6%).  Government Services (GS) had an increase of $49.1
          million (6.7%) while Commercial Services (CS) had a decrease of
          $7.4 million (4.0%).  The increase in GS's revenues includes
          approximately $15.1 million from businesses acquired in December
          1992 and February and December 1993, $16.0 million from the
          Postal contracts which were in the start-up phase in 1992 but
          were fully operational in 1993, and $17.9 million from new
          contract awards offset partially by contracts completed and/or
          not renewed.  The overall decline in CS's 1993 revenues results
          from low volume in the aircraft maintenance activities and the
          impact of relocating the Miami, Florida maintenance operation to
          a new hangar facility; offset partially by increases in ground
          support services.  Aircraft maintenance 1993 revenues decreased
          to $57.3 from $74.3 million in 1992 while ground support
          services' 1993 revenues increased to $118.6 million from $109.0
          million in 1992.

          The increase in 1992 revenues of $104.2 million (11.9%) over 1991
          was attributable to a combination of internal growth and the
          effect of acquisitions;  GS increased $73.6 million (11.2%) and
          CS increased $30.6 million (20.1%).  The increase in GS's
          revenues includes approximately $18.2 million from businesses
          acquired in April and May of 1991, $16.3 million from the Postal
          Service contracts awarded in the latter part of 1991 with the
          remaining increase attributable to the net increase in contract
          awards over contracts completed and/or not renewed.  The increase
          in CS's revenues includes $23.0 million from higher volume in
          aircraft maintenance and $7.6 million from ground support
          services.  The absence of the negative impact of the Persian Gulf
          War on ground support services also contributed to the overall
          increase in CS's 1992 revenues.

          Cost of Services/Gross Margins -  Cost of services was 95.8% of
          revenues in 1993, 96.9% in 1992 and 97% in 1991 which resulted in
          gross margins of $39.6 million (4.1%), $28.1 million (3.1%) and
          $23.9 million (3.0%) respectively.  GS's 1993 gross margins were
          improved while CS's 1993 margins declined from that of the prior
          year.  The improvement in GS's gross margins was principally due
          to improved profit performance on new contracts started in 1992
          and the early part of 1993 (in particular the Postal and the
          Department of Energy contracts).  CS's decline in gross margin
          was the result of reduced volume in the aircraft maintenance
          activities, offset partially by improved gross margins of the
          ground support activities.  Aircraft maintenance had gross margin
          losses of $6.6 million in 1993 compared to $.4 million in 1992.
          Also contributing to the decline in CS's margins were
          approximately $.6 million of costs associated with the relocation
          of the Miami, Florida aircraft maintenance operations to larger
          hangar facilities at the Miami, Florida airport.

          The 1992 gross margin, compared to 1991, was adversely impacted
          by approximately $7.0 million of nonrecurring insurance claims
          related to prior years, losses on the start-up of the new Postal
          contracts and a decline in GS's margins.  These charges and the
          decline in GS's margins substantially offset increased gross
          margins in CS maintenance activities and a reduction in the
          amount of amortization of merger related contract write-ups.

          Selling and Corporate Administrative - Selling and corporate
          administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 1.9% in
          1993 and 2.2% in both 1992 and 1991.  There were both increases
          and decreases in 1993 of the various elements and components of
          these expenses, however, the two most significant factors
          contributing to the decrease of $2.2 million from 1992 were cost
          reductions made in CS's general and administrative expenses and a
          decrease in GS's marketing and bid and proposal costs from the
          unusually high amount incurred in 1992 on a contract proposal for
          the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
          Louisiana.  Even though selling and corporate administrative
          expenses as a percentage of revenues were the same in both 1992
          and 1991, the dollar amount increased $2.5 million over 1991.
          This increase was caused principally by marketing and proposal
          costs associated with the bidding of the Department of Energy
          Contract mentioned above and costs, principally the addition of
          staff, incurred in developing new nondefense business and
          customers.

          Interest - Interest expense in 1993 of $25.5 million was $.6
          million higher than 1992.  This small increase was primarily the
          result of the Contract Receivable Collateralized Notes being
          outstanding for the full year of 1993 compared to approximately
          eleven months in 1992, interest on the mortgage for the Corporate
          office building was for the full year of 1993 compared to five
          months in 1992 and an increase in the amount of capitalized
          leases outstanding, all of which were partially offset by a
          reduction in the accrual of interest on possible payments of
          Federal income taxes.   Interest expense in 1992 was $24.9
          million compared to $18.9 in 1991.  This increase in 1992 was
          principally the result of the issuance of the Contract Receivable
          Collateralized Notes, compounding of Junior Subordinated
          Debentures due to pay-in-kind interest, accrual of interest on
          possible payments of federal income taxes and interest on the
          mortgage assumed on July 31, 1992 for the Corporate office
          building.

          Interest income in 1993 of $2.4 million was approximately the
          same as that in 1992 while interest income in 1992 was $.3
          million higher than 1991.  Even though interest rates were lower
          in 1992 than 1991, the Company had more excess funds available
          for investment and owned the Cummings Point Industries, Inc. note
          receivable with an interest rate of 17%.

          Other - The net increase in 1993 from 1992 is caused primarily by
          accelerated amortization of costs in excess of net assets of a
          recently acquired business and  legal and other expenses
          associated with another acquired business.  (The legal and other
          expenses relate to events which occurred prior to the businesses
          being acquired by the Company.)  The net decrease in 1992
          compared to 1991 is caused primarily by adjustment of reserves
          for environmental costs related to divested businesses,
          obligations to repurchase shares from terminated ESOP
          participants at a premium in excess of the fair value, and other
          transactions related to divested businesses.

          Income Taxes - In 1993, the Company recorded a foreign income tax
          provision and a state income tax benefit and in addition, for its
          majority owned subsidiary which is required to file a separate
          return, a federal income tax provision.  In 1992, the Company
          recorded only a foreign income tax provision.  In 1993 and 1992,
          the Company did not recognize any federal income tax benefit on
          its losses because of the uncertainty regarding the level of
          future income.  In 1991, the effective income tax rate was 32.3%.
          The income tax benefit for 1991 is less than the federal
          statutory rate because of nondeductibility of amortization of
          goodwill and value assigned to contracts and fixed assets in
          connection with the 1988 merger and reorganization.

          Cash Flow

             Cash and short-term investments increased to $22.8 million at
          December 31, 1993, from $20.0 million at the prior year-end.
          Working capital at December 31, 1993, was $73.8 million compared
          to $59.2 million at December 31, 1992.  The working capital
          increase was primarily the result of expanded business volume.
          The 1993 ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.53
          compared to 1.47 in 1992 (as restated).  At December 31, 1993,
          $17.6 million of cash and short-term investments and $107.1
          million of accounts receivable were restricted as collateral for
          the Contract Receivable Collateralized Notes.

             In 1993, operating activities produced cash flow of $10.6
          million compared to a negative cash flow of $4.7 million in 1992
          (for an improvement of $15.3 million).  The two major reasons for
          the improved cash flow from operating activities were a decrease
          of $9.9 million in the amount of loss for 1993 compared to 1992
          and an increase of $6.6 million of pay-in-kind interest on Junior
          Subordinated Debentures.  In 1992, the Company had voluntarily
          elected to pay the interest due December 31, 1992 in cash rather
          than pay-in-kind.

             Investing activities used $15.6 million of cash, of which
          $10.9 million was used for the acquisition of businesses (see
          Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
          elsewhere in this Form 10-K) and another $5.4 million was used
          for the purchase of property and equipment.  In addition, $1.3
          million of contract phase-in costs of a new long-term contract
          were incurred and deferred.  These costs will be amortized over
          the duration of the contract.  In 1992, investing activities used
          $18.1 million of cash.  The primary use of cash was the purchase
          of property and equipment for $11.4 million and another $4.6
          million was the net increase in notes receivable resulting
          primarily from the loan to Cummings Point Industries, Inc.  In
          1991, investing activities used $8.6 million of cash.  The
          principal uses were the purchase of property and equipment for
          $12.1 million and the acquisitions of businesses for $6.3 million
          offset by proceeds received from notes receivable of $8.4
          million.

             Financing activities provided cash of $7.8 million in 1993.
          Payments of $16.1 million were received on the loan to the
          Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the last and final payment on the
          loan from the Company was received in December, 1993), $6.3
          million was used for payments on indebtedness and $2 million was
          used to purchase treasury stock.  In 1992, financing activities
          provided cash of $26.9 million principally from the payments
          received from the ESOP plus surplus funds from the new financing
          arrangement of $100 million.  During 1992, the Company used $38.1
          million to pay in full its outstanding balance under the Restated
          Credit Agreement, $33.3 million for redemption of all of the
          outstanding Class A Preferred Stock plus accrued dividends and
          $10.2 million for the partial redemption of its 16% Junior
          Subordinated Debentures.  In 1991, the Company received payments
          of $15.4 from the ESOP and borrowed $6.0 million under its
          revolving credit, which funds were offset by payments on
          indebtedness of $17.0 million and the purchase of treasury stock
          and Junior Subordinated Debentures of $4.9 million.

             At December 31, 1993, the Company's debt totaled $220.3
          million compared to $202.4 million the prior year-end and $148.6
          million at December 31, 1991, including redeemable preferred
          stock.  The net increase in debt resulted principally from the
          pay-in-kind interest of $13.1 million on the Junior Subordinated
          Debentures and the $4.0 million mortgage assumed in the
          acquisition of Technology Applications, Inc.  The Company had a
          net increase in cash and short-term investments of $2.8 million,
          $4.1 million and $12.5 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
          respectively.  However, without the pay-in-kind interest on the
          Junior Subordinated Debentures (interest becomes payable in cash
          effective with the December 31, 1995 payment) and the payments
          received on the loan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP),
          the Company would have had a net decrease in cash and short-term
          investments of $26.4 million, $18.6 million and $14.8 million in
          1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  Annualized interest expense
          at January 1, 1994 is approximately $28.4 million of which $15.3
          million of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures is
          payable in kind.  The only significant debt maturing in the next
          three years is the mortgage of approximately $19 million on the
          Corporate Office, which matures in March, 1995.  The Company
          intends to refinance this mortgage before it matures.

             The Company believes that it can achieve the required cash
          flow by continued profit improvement, reduced debt service cost
          and/or the continuation of its contribution to the ESOP which can
          be used to purchase common stock from the Company.  The Company
          plans to continue its Value Improvement Program which was
          initiated in late 1992 to reduce and/or eliminate operating costs
          and loss operations, turn around the losses in Commercial
          Services' aircraft maintenance operations, and to improve the
          gross margins in Government Services.  To reduce its debt service
          costs, the Company is presently in discussions with its
          investment bankers to replace its high interest rate Junior
          Subordinated Debentures through the issuance of new senior notes
          or an initial public offering, or both.  In addition, the Company
          and the ESOP have an agreement in principal under which the ESOP
          will continue during 1994 to purchase Company common stock to
          fund the ESOP retirement benefit.

             The Company is also considering its alternatives, including
          the possible sale or spinoff, in respect to CS's aircraft
          maintenance unit which has incurred operating losses in the last
          three years.  Selected financial operating data of the aircraft
          maintenance unit is as follows (in thousands except number of
          employees):

                                          1993     1992     1991
             Revenues                   $57,288  $74,253  $51,221
             Operating losses           $(6,629)   $(428) $(1,137)
             Net assets including Goodwill
               at December 31,          $44,354  $43,328  $42,775
             Backlog at December 31,    $11,368  $     -  $12,584
             Number of employees            701      631      627

             These units are continuing to face an extremely competitive
          market with some competitors willing to buy market share at or
          below cost.  At this point, the Company does not believe that the
          assets and goodwill associated with this unit has been
          permanently impaired; however, it is possible that future events
          may require a write-down of the carrying value.

             Although the Company has made some progress to diversify into
          non-defense business activities, the Company is still heavily
          dependent on the Department of Defense.  Due to the procurement
          cycles of its customers (generally three to five years), the
          Company's revenues and margins are subject to continual
          recompetition.  In a typical annual cycle approximately 20%  to
          30% of the Company's business will be recompeted, and the Company
          will bid on several new contracts.  Existing contracts can be
          lost or rewon at lower margins at any time and new contracts can
          be won.  The net outcome of this bidding process, which in any
          one year can have a dramatic impact on future revenues and
          earnings, is impossible to predict.  Also, if the U.S. Government
          budget is reduced or spending shifts away from locations or
          contracts for which the Company provides services, the Company's
          success in retaining current contracts or obtaining new contracts
          could be significantly reduced.  The Company's Commercial
          Services business is likewise highly competitive and subject to
          the economic conditions of the domestic and foreign airline
          industry.

             In summary, the Company continues to be highly leveraged, and
          its ability to meet its future debt service and working capital
          requirements is dependent upon increased future earnings and cash
          flow from operations, extension of the ESOP and the reduction of
          its debt expense.
