Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
          Results of Operations.  

                            Results of Operations

     For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company had sales of $185.5
million and net income of $4.8 million or $.25 per share.  These results
compare with 1992 sales of $194.9 million and a net loss of $8.7 million or a
loss of $1.14 per share, and 1991 sales of $200.5 million and a net loss of
$35.9 million or a loss of $3.97 per share.  Earnings (loss) per share are
calculated after payment of preferred dividends.  

     The Company's 1993 sales decrease of 5% from the prior period is
attributable to both business segments.  The decrease in sales of 3% in the
motion technologies group was primarily caused by a decline in spending in
the military/aerospace portion of the business and changes in foreign
exchange rates.  Increased sales of 4% in the commercial portion of the
segment offset some of the 1993 revenue decline.  In the Company's electro-
optical instruments segment sales were down 7% from the prior year primarily
as a result of a decline in sales in the Company's commercial light and color
instrumentation businesses as the markets for these products were impacted by
the worldwide recession.

     Operating results for 1992 included a $10 million charge primarily for
the consolidation of the Company's French motor facilities and the
consolidation of several redundant functions in the domestic motion
technologies businesses.  Operating results for 1991 included a restructuring
charge of $16.7 million primarily for employee severance costs and to write-
off non-performing assets.  In addition, $9.6 million was charged to
operations in 1991 for estimates to complete long-term military contracts. 
By the end of 1993 the Company had completed most of its restructuring
activities which began in 1991 and the actual requirements were consistent
with the original reserve amounts.  As a result, the Company's work force was
reduced by approximately 850 people and a substantial portion of the
facilities consolidation was complete by the end of 1993.  The Company had a
reserve balance of approximately $6.4 million at December 31, 1993,
principally for the completion of its facilities consolidation.  

     Research and development expense was $9.3 million in 1993 or 5.0% of
sales as compared to $10.6 million in 1992 (5.5% of sales) and $10.3 million
in 1991 (5.2% of sales).  The reduction between 1993 and 1992 is primarily a
result of decreased spending at the Company's French motor business due to
the consolidation of its facilities.  

     In 1993, interest expense, net, decreased to $4.1 million compared to
$5.2 million in 1992 and $6.0 million in 1991.  The decrease in both periods
is due to lower average outstanding borrowings in the Company's French
facilities, higher interest income from cash investments due to larger cash
balances, and a lower outstanding balance on long-term debt.  The use of
funds is more fully discussed under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  

     The Company recognized tax benefits on income of $.8 million, $.8
million and $1.6 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  In 1993, the
recognition of the income tax benefit resulted from resolutions of certain
prior year tax assessments.  The Company also recognized the income tax
benefits of applicable net operating losses and tax credits in 1992 and 1991
as a reduction in the provision for income taxes.  The benefit of unutilized
net operating losses and tax credits will be carried over to future periods
to reduce income taxes otherwise payable.  
 
                     Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The Company's consolidated cash, restricted cash and short-term
investments decreased by $4.8 million during 1993.  Operations provided $10.9
million, while $9.7 million was used for capital expenditures and investing
activities other than short-term investments.  Financing activities used $6.9
million.  

     The most significant changes in working capital included a decrease of
recoverable amounts on long-term contracts of $6.2 million as several
contracts were completed during the course of the year.  Inventories were
reduced by $1.2 million and accounts and notes receivable reduced by $2.1
million as result of increased efforts towards reducing working capital
requirements.  Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by $8.5
million primarily as a result of expenses related to the Company's
restructurings which were paid during the year consisting primarily of
severance payouts.  


13


     The Company's investing activities included expenditures of $5.5 million
for property, plant and equipment.  In addition, the Company purchased an
unutilized leased facility for $4.3 million in cash as consideration for the
termination of a 20-year lease having 13 years remaining.  In addition, the
Company assumed a $2.0 million mortgage for the property and the net
realizable value of the property of $3.0 million is included in assets held
for sale.  The estimated loss in value of the property was recorded in the
1992 restructuring.  

     The Company's financing activities used $6.9 million of cash during the
year of which dividends, both common and preferred, accounted for $3.0
million while repayments under existing credit lines and long-term debt
accounted for $3.9 million.  

     Under the terms of the current bank agreement, the Company maintains a
cash balance equal to approximately 50% of the outstanding standby letters of
credit.  The cash is held in custody by the issuing bank in an interest-
bearing account and is restricted to withdrawal or use.  Accordingly, the
Company has classified these funds as restricted cash of $6.7 million.  At
December 31, 1993, the Company was contingently liable for $9.4 million for
outstanding standby letters of credit issued principally to secure advance
payments received from customers on long-term military contracts.  

     In accordance with the terms of the Company's two convertible
subordinated debentures, the Company is required to pay $3.8 million in
sinking fund payments during 1994 and additional amounts in future years.  

     Capital spending in 1994 is expected to be at similar levels to 1993. 
The Company believes that with the cash generated from operations and with
its current borrowing capacity it will be able to finance 1994 capital
expenditures and contribute the mandatory sinking fund payments.  

     In January 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  The Company
elected to amortize the transition obligation over 20 years.  The financial
statements include an expense of $.8 million in 1993.  

     In February 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS 109").  The adoption
of FAS 109 did not have a material effect on results of operations or
financial position.  

     The Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
112 "Employers' Accounting for Post-Employment Benefits" ("FAS 112") in 1994. 
FAS 112 requires that benefits to be paid to former or inactive employees
after employment but prior to retirement must be accrued if certain criteria
are not met.  The adoption of FAS 112 is not expected to have a material
financial impact on the Company.

                         Motion Technologies Group

     Revenues in the motion technologies group decreased to $112.8 million,
down 3% from $116.6 million in 1992 and down 7% from $120.6 million in 1991. 
The effect of foreign exchange rates accounted for 2% of the decrease in
sales in 1993.  Reduced sales in the military/aerospace portion of the
business were offset by an increase in volume in the domestic commercial
motors businesses.  The operating income was $9.2 million for 1993, compared
to a loss in 1992 of $2.5 million which included an $8 million restructuring
charge.  The increase in operating income is a result of improved gross
margins in the commercial and industrial businesses, reduced administrative
and research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of
various domestic and French facilities.  These spending reductions were
slightly offset by increased spending in sales and marketing expenses in our
commercial motors businesses as the Company expanded its sales organization
by opening regional sales offices during the year in order to increase its
direct sales efforts under the reorganized structure.  Operating income was
$.1 million in 1991 which included a restructuring charge of $5.8 million.  

     New orders for this segment were up 3% in 1993 over 1992 as orders for
commercial and industrial motors increased.  New orders for military and
aerospace products were essentially unchanged compared to 1992 results. 
Backlog at the end of 1993 was $52.2 million compared to $49.9 million in
1992.  

     Capital expenditures in 1993 and 1992 for this segment was $3.3 million
and $3.1 million, respectively, most of which was for replacement of existing
equipment and investments in new equipment to improve efficiency and quality
of products.  

                          Electro-Optical Instruments

     Revenues in the electro-optical instruments segment decreased to $72.8
million, down 7% from $78.3 million in 1992, and down 9% from $79.9 million
in 1991.  The decrease in 1993 was principally due to reduced sales in the
commercial light and color instrumentation businesses.  The decrease in 1992
over 1991 was due primarily to reduced sales in the Company's Electro-Optical
Division as receipts of long-term orders were delayed, but were partially
offset by increased revenues at our Proto-Power subsidiary.  Operating income
in this segment was $3.1 million, compared to a $4.1 million in 1992 and a
$13.4 million loss in 1991, including an $11.1 million restructuring charge. 
The decrease in operating profit in 1993 is due to lower margins on reduced
sales in the commercial color and light measurement products businesses and
lower gross margins on military contracts at the Electro-Optical Division. 
Reductions in operating expenses of $1 million between 1993 and 1992 helped
offset the decline in margins.  

     The backlog for the electro-optical instruments segment was $58.3
million at the end of 1993 up 21% from $48.1 million at the end of the
previous year.  The backlog increase is due to long-term orders at the
Electro-Optical Division for periscopes and optronic sights received during
the year. 


15


     During 1993 the electro-optical instruments segment spent $2.1 million
on capital equipment primarily for replacement and maintenance of existing
equipment.  

     The Company's leased facility in Chatsworth, California, which
manufactures high-end light measurement products, was damaged during the
earthquake on January 17, 1994.  The damage caused portions of the operations
to be temporarily interrupted.  Due to this disruption the Company
anticipates a lower sales volume at this facility during the first quarter of
1994.  The Company maintains an adequate amount of property and business
interruption insurance to cover all assessed damages and, therefore, does not
anticipate the impact on earnings in the first quarter of 1994 to be
material.  

     General corporate expenses included interest expense (net of investment
income), and general and administrative expenses.  In addition, the general
corporate amounts include restructuring and other non-recurring costs of $2
million in 1992, $9.4 million in 1991.  General corporate assets consist
principally of cash and investments, as well as net assets held for
disposition.
