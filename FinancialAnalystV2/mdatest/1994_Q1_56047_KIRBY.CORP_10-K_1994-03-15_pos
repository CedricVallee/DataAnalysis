ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The Company reported net earnings for the 1993 year of $22,829,000, or $.86
per share, compared with net earnings before the cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles for the 1992 year of $13,598,000, or $.60 per share, and
net earnings of $13,298,000, or $.61 per share, for 1991. Net earnings for 1992
were $681,000, or $.03 per share.
 
     The Company adopted, effective January 1, 1992, Accounting Standards No.
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" and
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Collectively, the
recognition of the cumulative effect of the adoption of the Accounting Standards
for all prior years reduced the Company's 1992 net earnings by $12,917,000, or
$.57 per share. The adoption of both Accounting Standards also reduced the
Company's 1992 operating earnings after taxes by $1,271,000, or $.06 per share.
 
     Accounting Standards No. 106 established a new accounting principle for the
cost of retiree health care benefits. The cumulative effect on prior years for
the change in accounting principle resulted in an expense after applicable
income taxes of $2,258,000, or $.10 per share. In addition to the impact of the
cumulative effect on prior years, the effect of adoption of Accounting Standards
No. 106 reduced the Company's 1992 operating earnings after applicable income
taxes by $355,000, or $.02 per share.
 
     Accounting Standards No. 109 required a change from the deferred method to
the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. The cumulative
effect on prior years for the change in accounting principle resulted in an
expense of $10,659,000, or $.47 per share. The effect of the adoption of
Accounting Standards No. 109 reduced the Company's 1992 operating earnings after
taxes by $916,000, or $.04 per share.
 
     In 1993, the corporate federal income tax rate was increased from 34% to
35%. In accordance with Accounting Standards No. 109, the effect of the increase
in the corporate federal income tax rate resulted in additional federal taxes of
$1,131,000, or $.04 per share, for 1993.
 
     The adoption of the Accounting Standards had no effect on the Company's
cash flow.
 
     The Company conducts operations in three business segments: marine
transportation, diesel repair and property and casualty insurance. A discussion
of each segment follows:
 
MARINE TRANSPORTATION
 
     The Company's marine transportation revenues for the 1993 year totaled
$283,747,000, reflecting a 49% increase when compared with $190,214,000 reported
in 1992 and a 143% increase when compared with $117,003,000 reported in 1991.
The 49% increase for the 1993 year reflects the operations of three marine
transportation companies acquired during the 1992 year, one in March, one in
April and one in June, and the operations of three marine transportation
companies acquired during the 1993 year, TPT Transportation on
 
                                       21
   23
 
March 3, AFRAM on May 14 and Chotin Transportation on December 21, all of which
were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Collectively, the
operations of TPT Transportation, AFRAM and Chotin Transportation generated
revenues during 1993 of approximately $61,400,000 since their dates of
acquisition. In addition, the revenues for each year reflect the new and
existing equipment additions to both the inland and offshore fleets made during
the years.
 
     The transportation segment's inland operations were curtailed to some
degree during the 1993 third quarter by flooding in the upper Mississippi River
and the closing of the Algiers Lock at New Orleans. Collectively, the pretax
effect of the two events reduced the 1993 results by an estimated $2.4 million.
 
     Flooding in the upper Mississippi River closed the upper River to marine
transportation movements from June 24 through August 22 and continued to disrupt
deliveries even after that date. Movements north of Cairo, Illinois were
curtailed substantially; several of the inland river towing units were stranded
by the flood; and the segment's lower Mississippi River marine operations were
rescheduled. The closing of the Algiers Lock for repair from July 1 through
September 10 required the inland towing vessels to use alternate routes, which
resulted in time delays. The Algiers Lock is situated along the main artery of
the Intracoastal Waterway near New Orleans.
 
     As a provider of service for both the inland and offshore United States
markets, the marine transportation segment is divided into three divisions
organized around the markets they serve: the Inland Chemical Division, serving
the inland industrial and agricultural chemical markets; the Inland Refined
Products Division, serving the inland refined products market; and the Offshore
Division, which serves the offshore petroleum products, container, dry bulk and
palletized cargo markets.
 
     Movements of inland industrial chemicals for the petrochemical processing
industry, handled by the segment's Inland Chemical Division, were intermittently
weak during the 1993 year. In the latter part of the 1993 first quarter, the
Inland Chemical Division's equipment utilization and rates reflected signs of
improvement from the recessionary pressures which negatively influenced the
market during all of 1992 as well as the second half of 1991. While the
improvement continued through the 1993 second quarter, equipment utilization was
somewhat lower during the 1993 third quarter and remained static during the
balance of 1993. Budgetary constraints by petrochemical manufacturers have held
back needed rate increases.
 
     Movements of liquid fertilizer and anhydrous ammonia have remained at high
levels for the 1993, 1992 and 1991 years due to continued heavy usage of
fertilizer products and consistent export sales. For the 1993 year, the
movements of liquid fertilizer were conducted well past the normal fertilizer
season, as fertilizer terminals which could not be reached during the flooding
in the upper Mississippi River were supplied and the demand for fertilizer was
enhanced due to flooding of the River farmlands.
 
     The Inland Refined Products Division, which moves inland refined products
(gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel) reflected improvements during the 1993 year
primarily due to a strong demand for gasoline and the resupplying of terminals
in the upper Mississippi River flood areas. Such growth in demand benefitted
equipment utilization and enabled modest rate increases. The Inland Refined
Products Division, formed in 1992 with the acquisitions by Sabine Transportation
and OMR Transportation, reflected weakness of demand during the 1992 year, as
the peak driving season fell below expectations.
 
     Revenues from the Offshore Division improved significantly during the 1993
year, primarily from the merger with AFRAM Lines on May 14, 1993. Throughout
1993, the Division's dry bulk, container and palletized cargo vessels have
remained in heavy demand, being taken out of service only for scheduled
maintenance. The merger with AFRAM Lines has improved the Division's ability to
transport cargos for United States Government aid programs and military use. The
Offshore Division's liquid market, however, has shown price and demand weakness
due to excess capacity in the offshore liquid market, particularly affecting
spot prices. During 1993, certain equipment was idle due to lack of business.
For the 1992 year, revenues from the Offshore Division were significantly
enhanced with the addition of Sabine Transportation's six tank ships, all of
which were fully booked, except for periods of scheduled maintenance.
 
     Each year includes gains from the disposition of primarily single skin
barges and other surplus or obsolete transportation assets. Such gains totaled
$525,000 for 1993, $494,000 for 1992 and $1,414,000 for 1991.
 
                                       22
   24
 
     Costs and expenses, excluding interest expense, for the marine
transportation segment for the 1993 year increased to $242,553,000, an increase
of 49% over the comparable 1992 expense of $162,973,000 and 140% over 1991 costs
and expenses of $100,884,000. Most of the increases for both comparable periods
reflect the costs and expenses, including depreciation, associated with the
acquisitions and mergers consummated during the 1993 and 1992 years. In
addition, the increases reflect higher equipment costs, employee health and
welfare costs, general and administrative costs and inflationary increases in
costs and expenses.
 
     The marine transportation pretax earnings for 1993 were $35,668,000, an
increase of 63% over 1992 pretax earnings of $21,836,000 and 164% over 1991
pretax earnings of $13,507,000.
 
DIESEL REPAIR
 
     The Company's diesel repair segment reported diesel repair revenues of
$31,952,000 for 1993 reflecting an 11% decrease compared with $35,753,000 for
1992 and a 7% decrease compared with $34,288,000 for 1991. With diesel repair
facilities in five locations nationwide that cater to specific markets, each
location has been influenced by different economic or environmental conditions
during the three comparable periods. The East Coast facility, catering to the
military, has been slowed in 1993 and 1992 by United States military reductions
and government budget restraints. The Midwest facility, which caters to the
inland barge industry, has been hampered to some degree in 1993 and 1992 by the
recession, however, the 1993 year was significantly affected by the flooding in
the upper Mississippi River during the 1993 third quarter. Revenues from the
segment's Midwest facility were reduced by an estimated $900,000, as customers
affected by the flooding either curtailed or postponed scheduled repairs and
overhauls and significantly curtailed parts purchases. The Gulf Coast facility,
tied to the inland and offshore barge and oil service industries was hampered
during 1992 by the recession, however, during 1993, business has remained
relatively constant. The West Coast facilities, whose primary emphasis is the
offshore tuna fishing industry, were negatively affected during 1993 and 1992 by
deferred maintenance of equipment by their commercial fishing customers due to
low tuna prices caused by the worldwide surplus of tuna. Diesel repair revenues
increased by $6,000,000 in 1992 and $2,000,000 in 1991 due to the West Coast
facility acquisition in July, 1991.
 
     Costs and expenses, excluding interest expense, for the diesel repair
segment for 1993 totaled $30,121,000, compared with $33,328,000 for 1992 and
$31,904,000 for 1991. The decrease of 10% for 1993 when compared with 1992
reflects the overall decline in revenues and its effect on the segment's profit
margins. The increase for 1992 and 1991 reflects the growth of the segment's
direct parts sales and overhaul and repair revenues. In addition, for the 1992
year, the increase in costs and expenses partially reflects the opening of the
Seattle facility and the acquisition of the West Coast facility in 1991, which
also increased the 1991 costs and expenses.
 
     The diesel repair segment's pretax earnings for 1993 were $1,577,000, a
decrease of 30% compared with 1992 pretax earnings of $2,263,000 and 29% under
1991 pretax earnings of $2,213,000.
 
PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE
 
     The Company's property and casualty insurance segment, which is conducted
primarily through Universal, reported premiums written of $80,993,000 for 1993,
compared with $52,830,000 for 1992 and $36,481,000 for 1991. The 53% increase in
premiums written during 1993 compared with 1992 reflected business generated
from Eastern America's portfolio brought in with the merger of Eastern America
with and into Universal in September, 1992, a new government policy, two vehicle
single-interest portfolio transfers and the addition of vehicle single-interest
business from two financial institutions, which was the result of an improvement
in automobile sales during 1993. The 45% increase in premiums written during
1992 compared with 1991 reflected the increased emphasis in participation in the
commercial multi-peril and double-interest lines of business, as premium volumes
in the automobile single-interest line remained low due to depressed new
automobile sales in Puerto Rico. Premiums written for the 1992 year also
included $3 million of single-interest premiums associated with a portfolio
transfer which occurred during the 1992 first quarter. In addition, the 1992
year reflected the merger of Eastern America with and into Universal. Premiums
written in
 
                                       23
   25
 
1991 reflected the reduction in the automobile single-interest line, offset to
some degree by increased participation in the commercial multiple-peril and
automobile double-interest lines of business.
 
     Net premiums earned for 1993 totaled $48,243,000 compared with $29,552,000
for 1992 and $23,561,000 for 1991. The 63% increase in net premiums earned
during 1993 compared with 1992 reflected the business generated from the Eastern
America portfolio as well as a significant increase in the single-interest line
of business during 1993. Net premiums earned for all three years were negatively
affected by the high reinsurance costs for the commercial multiple-peril line
associated with the ceding of a portion of the gross premium under the segment's
reinsurance program. Due to the number of worldwide catastrophic events within
the past few years, the cost of the segment's reinsurance program continued to
substantially increase.
 
     Investment income is generated primarily from the segment's investment in
United States Treasury securities, due to their investment safety and favorable
Puerto Rico tax treatment. Investment income totaled $7,741,000 for 1993
compared with $6,454,000 for 1992 and $5,994,000 for 1991. The segment, prior to
the decline in interest rates, procured a constant yield from the purchase of
United States Treasury securities with fixed rates. Even though interest rates
on investment securities have remained low since 1991, the insurance segment's
investment portfolio has reflected excellent market performance during 1992 and
1993. In addition, the 1993 investment income reflected the full year effect of
the merger with Eastern America. The investment portfolio of Eastern America at
the date of the merger totaled approximately $21 million. In addition, the
insurance segment recognized investment gains of $1,164,000 in 1993, $1,478,000
in 1992 and $853,000 in 1991.
 
     Losses, claims and settlement expenses for 1993 totaled $37,496,000
compared with $26,289,000 for 1992 and $18,103,000 for 1991. The 43% increase
for 1993 compared with 1992 reflected the merger with Eastern America as well as
the significant increase in business volume, particularly from the
single-interest line. In addition, the 1992 year reflected an abnormal year for
losses from the commercial multiple-peril line, which experienced high losses
from specific events. The 1992 year also included a reserve of $2,500,000
recorded in Mariner, the Company's Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary, which
participated in the writing of property and casualty lines of reinsurance from
1970 through 1990. During 1992, Mariner received certain delayed large loss
advices, which resulted in the increase in its loss reserves. The 1990 year was
the last year for participation in the reinsurance market. For the 1991 year,
the insurance segment's loss experience was favorable, the result of a decrease
in losses from the commercial multiple-peril and automobile single-interest
lines.
 
     Management continues to review the runoff of the reinsurance business
previously written by Mariner with the intent of seeking an expedient withdrawal
from this business and closure of Mariner's activities, including consideration
of commutation of Mariner's book of business. A commutation would entail the
transfer of liability from known and incurred but not reported losses to a
second party in exchange for a portion of, or all of, Mariner's assets. As of
December 31, 1993, the Company had net equity in Mariner of approximately
$1,500,000.
 
     Policy acquisition costs for 1993 totaled $11,085,000 compared with
$8,649,000 for 1992 and $7,181,000 for 1991. Generally, policy acquisition costs
for each year increased due to the higher commission rates associated with the
property insurance lines. The results for the 1993 and 1992 year also reflected
the merger with Eastern America.
 
     As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Company owned 70% and 75%,
respectively, of the voting common stock of Universal, with the balance owned by
Eastern America Group. The Company owned 100% of the non-voting common and
preferred stocks. Minority interest expense for the 1993 year totaled
$1,623,000.
 
     The Company's portion of the property and casualty insurance segment's
pretax earnings totaled $4,539,000 for 1993, compared with $1,108,000 for 1992
and $4,891,000 for 1991.
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
 
     In October, 1990, the Board of Directors approved the authorization to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of common stock. Currently, approximately 1,700,000
shares remain under the repurchase authorization. The
 
                                       24
   26
 
Company is authorized to purchase the common stock on the American Stock
Exchange and in private negotiated transactions. When repurchasing common
shares, the Company is subject to price, trading volume and other market
considerations. Shares repurchased may be used for reissuance upon the exercise
of stock options and other purposes. The purchase of additional shares depends
on numerous conditions, including the price of the common stock, capital
investment opportunities and other factors. From 1988 through January, 1991, the
Company purchased approximately 2,300,000 shares of common stock at an average
price of $5.71 per share.
 
     The Company and Dixie have separate revolving credit agreements with an
established line of credit of $50,000,000 each. Proceeds under the credit
agreements, which provide for interest rates, based at the Company's option, on
the prime rate, Eurodollar rate or CD rates, can be used for general corporate
purposes, the purchase of new or existing equipment or for business
acquisitions. As of March 14, 1994, the Company and Dixie had $33,600,000 and
$33,900,000, respectively, available for takedown under the credit agreements.
The Company and Dixie entered into the separate credit agreements in April, 1993
providing for aggregate borrowings of up to $30,000,000 and $50,000,000,
respectively. In August, 1993, the Company's line of credit was increased to
$50,000,000.
 
     In March, 1992, Dixie entered into a $20,000,000 acquisition credit
facility with Texas Commerce Bank National Association which provided the
transportation segment with in-place financing for possible future acquisitions.
On June 1, 1992, the acquisition credit facility was activated with the merger
of Scott Chotin into a subsidiary of the Company and in August, 1992, the
acquisition credit facility was retired.
 
     In August, 1992, Dixie sold $50,000,000 of 8.22% notes, due June 30, 2002,
in a private placement. Proceeds from these notes were used to retire the
$20,000,000 acquisition credit facility with Texas Commerce Bank National
Association and the retirement of two $5,000,000, 10% subordinated promissory
notes originally issued as part of the purchase in 1989 of the assets of Brent,
with the balance of the proceeds used to reduce the amount outstanding under
Dixie's $50,000,000 revolving credit agreement.
 
     In May, 1993, the Company called for redemption on June 4, 1993, the entire
$50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7 1/4% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2014 ("Debentures") issued in October, 1989 at a redemption price
of 105.075% of the principal amount of the Debentures, plus accrued interest on
the principal of the Debentures from April 1, 1993 to the date fixed for
redemption. Prior to, or on May 27, 1993, the fifth business day prior to the
date set for redemption under the Debentures, the holders of the entire
$50,000,000 of Debentures elected to convert such Debentures into common stock
of the Company at a conversion price of $11.125 per share. The conversion of the
Debentures increased the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company by
4,494,382 shares.
 
  Business Acquisitions and Developments
 
     Following the Company's stated strategy of acquiring businesses to
complement its existing operations, the Company has been actively engaged in the
acquisition of, or merger with, companies during the 1991, 1992 and 1993 years.
 
     In May, 1991, Brent Transportation purchased for $2,550,000 in cash all of
the operating assets of International Barges, Inc. The assets consist of three
cryogenic inland tank barges currently operating under a term contract
transporting industrial anhydrous ammonia. The acquisition incorporates the
handling of industrial anhydrous ammonia with Brent Transportation's established
market position in the transporting of anhydrous ammonia for use in agriculture.
 
     In July, 1991, Marine Systems purchased the operating assets of Steve
Ewing's Diesel Service, Inc., a National City, California based company engaged
in the repair and overhaul of marine diesel engines and related parts sales. The
acquired assets, consisting of inventory and fixed assets, are operated under
the name of Ewing Marine Systems, Inc. The acquisition expanded the diesel
repair segment's markets to the West Coast and the Pacific Basin and enables the
segment to offer nationwide service to its customers.
 
     On March 13, 1992, the Company completed the purchase of Sabine for
$36,950,000 in cash. Sabine, located in Port Arthur, Texas, was engaged in
coastal and inland marine transportation of petroleum products
 
                                       25
   27
 
and in harbor tug services. The purchased properties included six U.S. flag tank
ships, 33 owned and five leased inland tank barges, 11 owned and four leased
towboats, three owned bowboats, eight owned tugboats, land and buildings. The
Company has continued to use the assets of Sabine in the same business that
Sabine conducted prior to the purchase. The purchase was financed through
$9,950,000 of existing cash balances, borrowings of $9,000,000 under the
transportation segment's bank revolving credit agreement, as well as an
$18,000,000 bank term loan with a negative pledge of the assets acquired from
Sabine. Based on audited information, assets acquired from Sabine had total
revenues for the years ended December 31, 1990 and 1991 of $62,886,000 and
$62,986,000, respectively. Operations of the assets acquired from Sabine are
included as part of the Company's operations effective March 13, 1992, in
accordance with the purchase method of accounting.
 
     On April 2, 1992, OMR Transportation completed the purchase of Ole Man
River for $25,575,000 in cash. Ole Man River, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi,
was engaged in inland marine tank barge transportation of petroleum products
along the Mississippi River System and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The
purchased properties included 24 owned and two leased tank barges, eight owned
towboats, land and buildings. The Company has continued to use the assets of Ole
Man River in the same business that Ole Man River conducted prior to the
purchase. The asset purchase was funded by borrowings under the transportation
segment's bank revolving credit agreement. Based on audited information, Ole Man
River had total revenues for the years ended December 31, 1990 and 1991 of
$14,676,000 and $15,550,000, respectively. Operations of the assets acquired
from Ole Man River are included as part of the Company's operations effective
April 2, 1992, in accordance with the purchase method of accounting.
 
     On June 1, 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of Scott Chotin by
means of a merger with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company for an
aggregate consideration of approximately $34,900,000. Pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, the Company issued 870,892 shares of common stock, valued at
$12.625 per share, to certain Scott Chotin shareholders and paid the
shareholders of Scott Chotin approximately $9,700,000 in cash in exchange for
the working capital and all of the outstanding common stock of Scott Chotin,
discharged existing debt of Scott Chotin of approximately $7,400,000 and paid to
certain executives and shareholders of Scott Chotin $5,000,000 for agreements
not to compete. In addition, the Company recorded a liability reserve for the
issuance, over a three-year period after the closing, of up to 170,000
additional shares of the Company's stock contingent upon the resolution of
certain potential liabilities resulting from operations of Scott Chotin prior to
the merger. In June, 1993, the Company issued 22,500 shares under the contingent
stock agreement. Scott Chotin, located in Mandeville, Louisiana, was engaged in
inland marine tank barge transportation of industrial chemicals and asphalt
along the Mississippi River System and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Scott
Chotin's inland fleet consisted of 29 owned tank barges, six of which operate in
the asphalt trade, 10 owned dry cargo barges, eight owned towboats, land and
buildings. The Company has continued to use the assets of Scott Chotin in the
same business that Scott Chotin conducted prior to the merger. The cash portion
of the merger was financed through existing cash balances, borrowings under a
subsidiary of the Company's $20,000,000 acquisition line of credit, as well as a
$16,000,000 bank term loan with a negative pledge of the assets. Based on
audited information, Scott Chotin recorded total revenues for the years ended
May 31, 1991 and 1992 of $20,894,000 and $18,817,000, respectively. Scott
Chotin's operations are included as part of the Company's operations effective
June 1, 1992, in accordance with the purchase method of accounting.
 
     On September 25, 1992, the Company completed the acquisition of Eastern
America, a property and casualty insurance company in Puerto Rico, by means of a
merger of Eastern America with and into the Company's insurance subsidiary,
Universal, with Universal being the surviving entity. Presently, the Company
owns approximately 70% of the voting common stock of Universal, with the
remaining approximately 30% owned by Eastern America Group, the former parent of
Eastern America. Through options and redemption rights included in the merger
transaction, Eastern America Group could become the owner of up to 100% of
Universal's stock over a period of up to 12 years. Based on audited information,

     On March 3, 1993, TPT Transportation completed the purchase of TPT, a
marine transportation division of Ashland Oil, Inc., for approximately
$24,400,000 in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. TPT was engaged in the
inland marine transportation of industrial chemicals and lube oil primarily from
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway to customers primarily on the upper Ohio River.
TPT's inland fleet consisted of 61 owned and six leased double skin tank barges,
four owned and one leased single skin tank barges and five owned towboats. Of
the 72 barges, 32 are equipped with vapor control systems while 30 barges are

not required. The Company has continued to use the assets of TPT in the same
business that TPT conducted prior to the purchase. The asset purchase was
financed under the transportation segment's bank revolving credit agreement.
Based on unaudited information, TPT had total revenues for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1992, of $17 million. The asset purchase was accounted for in
accordance with the purchase method of accounting effective March 3, 1993.
 
     On May 14, 1993, the Company completed the acquisition of AFRAM Lines by
means of a merger with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, for an
aggregate consideration of $16,725,000. In addition, the merger provides for an
earnout provision not to exceed $3,000,000 in any one year and not to exceed a
maximum of $10,000,000 over a four year period. The earnout provision will be
recorded as incurred as an adjustment to the purchase price. As of December 31,
1993, a $2,250,000 earnout provision, which accrues from April 1 to March 31 of
the following year, had been recorded. Under the terms of the merger, the
Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of AFRAM
Lines outstanding stock and paid certain executives and shareholders of AFRAM
Lines agreements not to compete totaling $2,000,000. AFRAM Lines located in
Houston, Texas, was engaged in the worldwide transportation of dry bulk,
container and palletized cargos, primarily for Departments and Agencies of the
United States Government. The Company has continued to use the assets of AFRAM
Lines in the same business that AFRAM Lines conducted prior to the merger. AFRAM
Lines fleet consisted of three U.S. flag container and break-bulk ships which
specialize in the transportation of United States Government military and aid
cargos. Based on audited information, AFRAM Lines recorded transportation
revenues for the years ended June 30, 1992 and 1991 of $38,758,000 and
$29,817,000, respectively. Unaudited historical transportation revenues for the
year ended December 31, 1992 were $46,268,000. The merger, effective as of April
1, 1993, was accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting.
The financial results for the 1993 year include the net earnings from the
operations from May 14, 1993, as the net earnings from April 1, 1993 to May 14,
1993, were recorded as a reduction of the purchase price.
 
     In May, 1993, Marine Systems enhanced its long-term opportunities with the
addition of two distributorship agreements. Under a long-term agreement with
Paxman Diesels, Ltd. of Colchester, England, a manufacturer of diesel engines,
Marine Systems will sell engine parts and offer authorized repair services. In
addition, in May, 1993, Marine Systems signed a long-term agreement with Falk
Corporation, a marine reduction gear manufacturer, whereby Marine Systems will
sell parts and offer authorized repair services.
 
     As an expansion of the diesel repair segment, the Company is engaged
through Rail Systems in the overhaul and repair of locomotive diesel engines and
sale of replacement parts for locomotives, serving shortline and industrial
railroads within the continental United States. In October, 1993, EMD, the
world's largest manufacturer of diesel-electric locomotives, awarded an
exclusive shortline and industrial rail distributorship to Rail Systems to
provide replacement parts, service and support to these important and expanding
markets. The operations of Rail Systems commenced in January, 1994.
 
     On December 21, 1993, OMR Transportation completed the cash purchase of
certain assets of Chotin Transportation. Chotin Transportation, located in
Cincinnati, Ohio, was engaged in the inland marine transportation of refined
products by tank barge primarily from the lower Mississippi River to the Ohio
River under a long-term contract with a major oil company. The purchased
properties included 50 single skin and three double skin inland tank barges and
a transportation contract, which expires in the year 2000. The asset purchase
was funded by borrowings under the transportation segment's bank revolving
credit agreement.

Operations of the assets acquired from Chotin Transportation are included as
part of the Company's operations effective December 21, 1993, in accordance with
the purchase method of accounting.
 
     In March, 1994, the Company through its subsidiary, Americas Marine, began
all-water marine transportation services between Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico,
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The new transportation service utilizes a
chartered foreign flag river/ocean vessel which offers direct sailing between
the locations. The new service provides exporters and importers in the north,
central and mid-south states with a direct shipping alternative between the
locations on a fourteen day round trip basis. The direct all-water liner service
accepts 20 foot and 40 foot containers, including refrigerated and tank
containers, as well as other cargo on a space available basis.
 
  Capital Expenditures
 
     The Company continued to enhance its existing operations through the
acquisitions of existing equipment during the 1991, 1992 and 1993 years and
construction of new equipment during the 1991 and 1992 years.
 
     During 1991, six new 29,000 barrel capacity double skin inland tank barges,
which were constructed under a contract entered into in May, 1990, were placed
in service. Three of the barges were placed into service in July, one in August
and two in September. The six barges cost approximately $8,000,000, including
enhancements after delivery. In March, 1991, an option was exercised to purchase
six additional 29,000 barrel capacity double skin inland tank barges at a total
purchase price including enhancements after delivery, of approximately
$8,000,000. The first barge was placed in service in November, 1991, followed by
one barge each month through March, 1992. The remaining barge was placed in
service in May, 1992.
 
     Through a 50% partnership with EFC, one dry cargo barge and tug unit for
use in the offshore market was purchased for approximately $5,500,000, with
capitalized restorations and modifications to the barge and tug unit of
approximately $7,500,000. The equipment was placed in service in May, 1991.
 
     In July, 1992, a 165,000 barrel double skin ocean-going tank barge and tug
unit was purchased for approximately $9,200,000. The unit is currently working
in the offshore refined products trade.
 
     In July, 1992, four existing inland towboats were purchased for a total
purchase price of $1,650,000. The towboats are being used in the industrial
chemical market.
 
     In July, 1992, the diesel repair segment expanded its market to the Pacific
Northwest with the opening of a service facility in Seattle, Washington, serving
both the inland and offshore marine industries. Emphasis is focused on the
repair of diesel engines in the marine transportation industry and various
governmental agencies.
 
     In August, 1992, a 17,000 barrel capacity pressure barge which was
constructed under a contract entered into in September, 1991, was placed into
service in the industrial chemical market. Cost of the barge was approximately
$2,700,000.
 
     In October, 1993, three inland towboats were purchased for approximately
$895,000. The towboats are being used in the refined products market.
 
     In addition to the new and existing transportation equipment mentioned
above, during 1991, 1992 and 1993, the Company's transportation subsidiaries
continued to add to their fleet through separate purchases of existing
equipment. In 1991, two existing towboats and seven existing double skin inland
tank barges were purchased for use in the industrial and agricultural chemical
market. In 1992, four inland tank barges were purchased and renovated for use in
the agricultural market and an inland towboat was purchased for use in the
refined products market. In 1993, three existing double skin inland tank barges
were purchased and renovated for use in the agricultural market and one inland
towboat was purchased for use in the fleeting and shifting operation.

  Liquidity
 
     Within the past three years, the Company has generated significant cash
flow from its operating segments to fund its capital expenditures, asset
acquisitions, debt service and other operating requirements. During 1993, 1992
and 1991, the Company generated net cash provided by operating activities of
$61,614,000, $38,372,000 and $26,498,000, respectively.
 
     During each year, inflation has had a relatively minor effect on the
financial results of the Company. The marine transportation segment has
long-term contracts which generally contain cost escalation clauses whereby
certain costs, including fuel can be passed through to its customers, while the
segment's short-term, or spot business, is based principally on current prices.
In addition, the marine transportation assets acquired and accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting were adjusted to a fair market value and,
therefore, the cumulative long-term effect on inflation was reduced. The repair
portion of the diesel repair segment is based on prevailing current market
rates. For the property and casualty insurance segment, 97% of its investments
were classified as available-for-sale or short-term investments, which consists
primarily of United States Governmental instruments.
 
     Universal is subject to dividend restrictions under the stockholders'
agreement between the Company, Universal and Eastern America Group. In addition,
Universal is subject to industry guidelines and regulations with respect to the
payment of dividends.
 
     The Company has no present plan to pay dividends on common stock in the
near future.
