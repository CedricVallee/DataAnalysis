Item 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Pages 20-24 of the Annual Report to shareholders for the year ended
December 31, 1993 are hereby incorporated by reference (reference
items (2) and (3) of the Appendix for a description of the graphic
material contained therein).

Subsequent to the mailing of the Annual Report to shareholders for the year
ended December 31, 1993, the Company received notice from the U.S. EPA
regarding potential liability at a third National Priorities List
site.  Because this matter is in its early stages, potential liability 
to the Company is difficult to estimate, although a preliminary review
indicates potential liability could amount to as much as $750,000.
