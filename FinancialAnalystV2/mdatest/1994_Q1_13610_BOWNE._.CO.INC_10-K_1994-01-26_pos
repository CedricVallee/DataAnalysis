ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     The Company has a strong financial position, with excellent liquidity. On
October 31, 1993, the Company had a working capital ratio of 2.36 to 1 and
working capital of $87,785,000.
 
     Cash generated from operations, available working capital and borrowings
have been used to finance acquisitions, capital expenditures, payment of debt,
purchase of treasury stock and payment of dividends. It is expected that such
funds and the Company's borrowing capacity will be sufficient to finance the
Company's growth, future capital expenditures, acquisition of treasury stock,
payment of dividends and possible acquisitions.
 
INFLATION
 
     The Company has experienced the effects of inflation through increases in
the costs of employee compensation and related fringe benefits, outside
services, raw materials and other supplies. Due to price competition, the
Company does not always fully recover all of its increased costs.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     The Company provides printing services to produce the varied documentation
required by major financial transactions, corporate periodic reports,
restructuring plans for bankrupt companies, communication to shareholders and
basic commercial printing. The sales value of each project is dependent, among
other things, upon the size, complexity and type of document printed, the time
allowed for completion and the level of changes required, and may be further
impacted by the level of competition.
 
     The Company's corporate printing business is seasonal to the extent that
the greatest number of proxy statements and annual reports are required to be
printed during the Company's second fiscal quarter ending April 30. In addition,
the Company's business is generally affected by cyclical conditions in the
capital markets.
 
     The general necessity for rapid document processing after delivery of copy
by its customers requires that the Company maintain physical plant and customer
service staff sufficient to meet maximum work loads. Consequently, the Company
does not always operate at full capacity. The costs for facilities, labor and
equipment constitute a major portion of the costs of goods sold. These costs do
not normally increase or decrease proportionally with changes in sales.
 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," is currently scheduled to become effective for the Company's fiscal year
ending October 31, 1994. The effect of the adoption of this statement will not
be material.
 
1993 COMPARED WITH 1992
 
     Sales increased 18%, to $333,255,000, due to even higher levels of debt and
equity offerings than a year earlier and increased levels of activity in mutual
funds and merger and acquisition work. The overall increase in sales combined
with a relatively constant gross margin percentage contributed to a $23,722,000
increase in gross margin.
 
     Other revenues increased $521,000 to $4,334,000 principally as a result of
capital gains related to the sale of surplus property.
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $12,434,000, or 16%, to
$90,322,000 principally as a result of increases in sales and incentive
compensation and other expenses related to higher sales and profitability, and
increases in the number of employees and the costs of facilities and labor.
 
     Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $381,000, or 3%, primarily
as a result of expansion of facilities.
 
     Interest expense decreased $545,000 due to the reduction of the Company's
debt.
 
                                        7

     The effective overall income tax rate remained relatively constant as the
new higher tax rate contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
was partially offset by the increased proportion of income earned in state and
foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
 
     As a result of the foregoing, income before income taxes increased
$11,973,000, or 25%, to $59,011,000 and net income increased $7,051,000, or 25%,
to $35,319,000.
 
1992 COMPARED WITH 1991
 
     Sales increased by $45,884,000, or 19%. The increase was primarily
attributable to increased debt and equity offerings during the year and the
Company's diversification into banking, bankruptcy and mutual fund printing
services. The overall increase in sales, combined with an increase of 2% in the
gross margin percentage, contributed to an increase in gross margin of
$27,386,000.
 
     Other revenues remained relatively unchanged as increases in earnings from
higher levels of investments were offset by lower interest rates.
 
     Selling and administrative expenses increased $7,384,000, or 10%, to
$77,888,000, principally as a result of sales and incentive compensation and
other expenses related to increases in sales and profitability.
 
     Depreciation and amortization decreased $1,215,000, or 9%, primarily as a
result of certain intangibles related to business acquisitions becoming fully
amortized at the end of 1991.
 
     Interest expense decreased $667,000, or 19%, primarily as a result of the
reduction of long-term debt.
 
     The income tax rate decreased from 43% to 40% as a result of an increased
proportion of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and the reduced proportion of
non-deductible items on higher earnings.
 
     As a result of the foregoing, income before income taxes increased
$21,947,000, or 87%, to $47,038,000 and net income increased $13,943,000, or
97%, to $28,268,000.
