ITEM 7.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
             FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
             (Abbreviated pursuant to General Instruction J(2)(a) of Form 10-K).

HIGHLIGHTS

SUMMARY   American's net income in 1993 was $23 million.  The 1993 results
reflect the negative impact of a five-day strike by the union representing
American's flight attendants in November.  The results also include a $125
million charge ($79 million after tax) for the retirement of certain DC-10
aircraft and a positive $115 million adjustment to revenues ($67 million net of
related commission expense and taxes) for a change in estimate related to
certain earned passenger revenues.  In 1992, American recorded a net loss of
$735 million.  The loss for 1992, before the effect of the adoption of two new
mandatory accounting standards, was $274 million.  The Company's 1993 operating
income was $564 million, compared to an operating loss of $77 million in 1992.

      In the first quarter of 1993, AMR created and began implementing a new
strategic framework, known as the Transition Plan.  The Plan has three parts,
each intended to improve results.  First, make AMR's core airline business
bigger and stronger where economically justified.  Second, and conversely,
shrink the airline where it cannot compete profitably.  Third, reallocate
resources and effort to AMR and American's growing information and management
services businesses which are more profitable than the airline.

      Major events relating to the Transition Plan in 1993 included:

.     The SABRE Technology Group -- later renamed The SABRE Group -- was formed
      during the second quarter of 1993.

.     American announced its decision to retire 42 widebody DC-10 jets to
      reduce the airline's capacity and lower operating expenses.

.     American shifted domestic capacity to its major hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth
      and Miami.  The AMR Eagle carriers added or increased service in certain
      other markets as American reduced or withdrew jet service.

.     American significantly reduced service at San Jose, California.

.     To provide increased value to business customers, American expanded its
      successful three-class transcontinental service to new markets, added
      more frequent flights on business routes such as Dallas/Fort Worth -
      Chicago, and added more first class seats on some narrowbody aircraft.

.     American increased capacity in Latin America by 17.5 percent over 1992.

      American's 1993 results benefited from strengthened domestic revenues in
comparison to 1992.  American's 1992 domestic revenues suffered from
competitive fare reductions below the levels American established in its Value
Pricing Plan in April 1992.  European revenues, however, were negatively
impacted in 1993 by aggressive fare discounting by competitors, weak European
economies and a stronger U.S. dollar.

      The Company's 1993 results also reflect the dramatic adverse impact of a
five-day strike by American's flight attendants' union in November.  The
strike's after-tax impact on fourth quarter results, estimated at $190 million,
offset earnings generated earlier in the year.

      With the downsizing of unprofitable operations, American's workforce
began to decline following years of double-digit percentage increases.  In
1993, American provided $25 million for employee severance, primarily
management/specialist and operations employees.

REVENUES
1993 COMPARED TO 1992   American's operating revenues increased 8.4 percent to
$14.7 billion in 1993, compared to $13.6 billion in 1992.  Passenger revenues
rose 8.4 percent, $1.0 billion, primarily as a result of an 8.8 percent
increase in passenger yield (the average amount one passenger pays to fly one
mile), partially offset by a 0.3 percent decline in passenger traffic.

      American's passenger yield in 1993 increased to 13.28 cents, primarily as
a result of a very weak comparison base of 1992, when revenues were negatively
impacted by competitors' drastic discounting of domestic fares.  For the year,
domestic yield increased 13.5 percent.  International yield was mixed,
increasing 13.9 percent in the Pacific, unchanged in Latin America and
declining 10.1 percent in Europe.  In 1993, American derived 73.8 percent of
its passenger revenues from domestic operations and 26.2 percent from
international operations.

      Although American's system capacity, as measured by available seat miles
(ASMs), increased 5.2 percent, its traffic, as measured by revenue passenger
miles (RPMs), decreased 0.3 percent.  The drastic fare discounting drove
traffic up to record levels in 1992.  Traffic suffered in 1993 from American's
inability to carry passengers during the flight attendants' union strike in
November and the adverse effect of the strike on passenger demand during the
month of December.  American's domestic traffic decreased 3.5 percent, to 69.7
billion RPMs, while domestic capacity grew 2.9 percent.  International traffic
grew 9.1 percent, to 27.5 billion RPMs on capacity growth of 12.1 percent.  The
increase in international traffic was led by a 14.7 percent increase in Latin
America on capacity growth of 17.5 percent, and a 7.4 percent increase in
Europe on capacity growth of 10.8 percent.

      Cargo revenues increased 10.4 percent, $60 million, driven by a 22.5
percent increase in American's domestic and international cargo volumes,
partially offset by decreasing yields brought about by strong price competition
resulting from excess industry capacity.

      Other revenues, consisting of service fees, liquor revenues, duty-free
sales, tour marketing and miscellaneous other revenues, increased 5.2 percent,
$26 million, primarily as a result of increased traffic.

      Information Services Group revenues increased 7.3 percent, $79 million,
primarily due to increased booking fees resulting from growth in booking
volumes and average fees collected from participating vendors.

EXPENSES
1993 COMPARED TO 1992   Operating expenses increased 3.8 percent, $515 million.
American's capacity increased 5.2 percent, to 160.9 billion ASMs, due primarily
to the addition of new aircraft.  American's Passenger Division cost per ASM
decreased by 2.0 percent, to 8.25 cents.

      Wages, salaries and benefits rose 5.1 percent, $237 million, due to wage
and salary adjustments for existing employees and rising health-care costs.  In
addition, during the fourth quarter, American recorded a $25 million severance
provision in conjunction with layoffs and voluntary terminations of
management/specialist and operations personnel.

      Aircraft fuel expense decreased 2.4 percent, $44 million, due to a 4.9
percent decrease in the average price per gallon, partially offset by a 2.7
percent increase in gallons consumed.  The average price per gallon decreased
from $0.65 per gallon in 1992 to $0.62 per gallon in 1993.  American consumed
an average of 245 million gallons of fuel each month.  A one-cent decline in
fuel prices saves approximately $2.5 million per month.

      Commissions to agents increased 10.3 percent, $130 million, due
principally to increased passenger revenues and increased incentives for travel
agents.

      Depreciation and amortization increased 16.4 percent, $157 million,
primarily due to the addition of 44 owned jet aircraft and other capital
equipment.

      Food service cost was flat, reflecting the 9.1 percent increase in
international traffic, where food costs are greater, offset by the 3.5 percent
decrease in domestic traffic.





                                      -12-
   14
      Maintenance materials and repairs expense decreased 8.9 percent, $53
million, due principally to the retirement of older aircraft and increased
operational efficiencies.

      Other operating expenses (including crew travel expenses, booking fees,
purchased services, communications charges, credit card fees and advertising)
increased 2.4 percent, $54 million, primarily due to the increase in capacity
and an increase in fees paid to affiliates for passengers connecting with
American flights.

      Interest capitalized decreased 50.0 percent, $49 million, as a result of
the decrease in the average balance during the year of purchase deposits for
flight equipment and the decline in interest rates.

      Miscellaneous - net for 1993 includes a $125 million charge related to
the retirement of 31 DC-10 aircraft.  Included in Miscellaneous - net for 1992
is a $14 million provision for a cash payment representing American's share of
a multi-carrier antitrust settlement.

OTHER INFORMATION

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS   As of December 31, 1993, the Company had deferred tax
assets aggregating approximately $2.0 billion, including approximately $337
million of alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards.  The Company
believes substantially all the deferred tax assets, other than the AMT credit
carryforwards, will be realized through reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences.  The Company anticipates using its AMT credit carryforwards, which
are available for an indefinite period of time, against its future regular tax
liability within the next 10 years for several reasons.  Although the Company
incurred net losses in 1990 through 1993, it recorded substantial income before
taxes and taxable income during the seven-year period 1983 through 1989 of
approximately $3.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.  The Company is
aggressively pursuing revenue enhancement and cost reduction initiatives to
restore profitability.  The Company has also substantially curtailed its
planned capital spending program, which will accelerate the reversal of
depreciation differences between financial and tax income, thus increasing
taxable income.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS   American has been notified of potential liability with
regard to several environmental cleanup sites.  At sites where remedial
litigation has commenced, potential liability is joint and several.  American's
alleged volumetric contributions at the sites are minimal.  American does not
expect these actions, individually or collectively, to have a material impact
on its financial condition, operating results or cash flows.

DISCOUNT RATE   Due to the decline in interest rates during 1993, the discount
rate used to determine the Company's pension obligations as of December 31,
1993 and the related expense for 1994, has been reduced.  The impact on 1994
pension expense of the change in the discount rate will be substantially offset
by the significant appreciation in the market value of pension plan assets
experienced during 1993.

PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION  During 1992, American and certain other
carriers agreed to settle various class action claims, subject to approval by
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.  Under the terms
of the agreement, the carriers paid a total of approximately $50 million in
cash and will jointly issue and distribute approximately $408 million in face
amount of certificates for discounts of approximately 10 percent on future air
travel on any of the carriers.  A liability has not been established for the
certificate portion of the settlement since American expects that, in the
aggregate, future revenues received upon redemption of the certificates will
exceed the related cost of providing the air travel.  American anticipates that
the share of the certificates redeemed on American may represent, but is not
limited to, American's 26 percent market share among the carriers.  The
ultimate impact of the settlement on American's revenues, operating margins and
earnings is not reasonably estimable since both the portion of certificates to
be redeemed on American and the stimulative or depressive effect of the
certificate redemption on revenues is not known.

OUTLOOK FOR 1994

During 1993, AMR completed a comprehensive review of the competitive realities
of its businesses and determined that it must change significantly in order to
generate sufficient earnings.  The fundamental problems of the airline --
increasing competition from low- cost, low-fare carriers, its inability to
reduce labor costs to competitive levels, and the changing values of its
customers -- demand new solutions.  As an initial response to that need, AMR
created and began implementing a new strategic framework known as the
Transition Plan.  The plan has three parts, each intended to improve AMR's
results.  First, make the core airline business bigger and stronger where
economically justified.  Second, and conversely, shrink the airline where it
cannot compete profitably.  Third, reallocate resources and effort to the
growing information and management services businesses, which are more
profitable than the airline.

      An integral part of the Transition Plan is the expansion of the business
activities of The SABRE Group.  The SABRE Group was formed as a business unit
during 1993, integrating reporting relationships among American's STIN, SCS and
SDS divisions and AMR's other information technology businesses.  AMR plans to
more fully develop and market its distinct information technology expertise
through The SABRE Group and continues to investigate opportunities for further
expanding its information technology businesses.  These opportunities may
include the combination of marketing and/or developmental functions of The
SABRE Group businesses and/or a formal reorganization of The SABRE Group into
one or more subsidiaries of AMR.  This formal reorganization, if concluded,
would likely involve the transfer to AMR, by means of a dividend, of American's
STIN, SCS and SDS divisions.  In addition, a formal reorganization would also
result in the Company's compliance with a recent directive from the European
Community Council of Ministers that, in effect, requires that a CRS operating
in the European Community have a legal status that is separate and apart from
its affiliated airline.

      Further, the Transition Plan recognizes the unfavorable and uncertain
economics which have characterized the core airline business in recent years,
acknowledges the airline cost problem and seeks to maximize the contribution of
the Company's more profitable businesses.  In 1994, AMR will continue the
course of change initiated in 1993 under the Transition Plan.  Over the long
term, AMR will continue its best efforts to reduce airline costs and to restore
the airline operations to profitability.  Based on the success or failure of
those efforts, AMR will make ongoing determinations as to the appropriate
degree of reallocation of resources from the airline operations to its other
businesses, which may include, if the airline cannot be run profitably, the
disposition or termination, over the long term, of a substantial part or all of
the airline operations.

AIR TRANSPORTATION GROUP   During 1993, American closed its hub and
dramatically reduced operations at San Jose, California, and expanded its
Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami hubs.  The airline will continue to reduce or
eliminate service where it cannot operate profitably.  American's regional
airline affiliates, subsidiaries of AMR Eagle, have added turboprop service on
some routes where jet service has been canceled, and they will continue to
pursue these opportunities in 1994.

      In 1993, American removed 21 McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and 28 Boeing 727
aircraft from service.  In 1994, an additional 14 DC- 10s and 31 727s will be
retired.  As a result, in 1994 American's available seat miles are expected to
decrease by almost five percent.  Domestic capacity will drop by almost seven
percent, while international capacity will increase slightly.  The capacity
reduction will be the first at American since 1981.

      Aircraft retirements have necessitated the furlough of about 3,700
American employees since late 1992.  The Company anticipates further workforce
reductions in 1994 and, accordingly, made a provision for the cost of these
reductions in 1993.  Fewer aircraft deliveries will also translate into lower
capital spending.

      American's revenue plan for 1994 reflects continued emphasis on producing
premium yields by attracting more full fare passengers than its competitors.
As part of this plan, American will expand its successful three-class domestic
transcontinental service, add more first class seats on some narrowbody
aircraft and increase frequencies in business-oriented markets.  In addition,
American will seek to grow its cargo revenues again in 1994.





                                      -14-
   16
      In 1993, American's Passenger Division cost per available seat mile
declined by 2.0 percent, largely due to a 4.9 percent drop in the cost of jet
fuel.  In 1994, though American will continue its rigorous program of cost
control, it expects units costs, excluding fuel, to rise modestly.  This
increase will be driven by higher unit labor costs due to pay scale and average
seniority escalations.

      On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act was signed into
law, imposing a new 4.3 cents per gallon tax on commercial aviation jet fuel
for use in domestic operations.  The new tax will become effective October 1,
1995, and is scheduled to continue until October 1, 1998.  American estimates
the resulting annual increase in fuel taxes will be approximately $90 million.

      AMR instituted a program in the latter half of 1993 to reduce interest
costs.  At year-end interest rates, the Company anticipates that this program,
which involves such things as interest rate swaps, will produce significant
interest cost savings.  This savings is expected to largely offset the
additional interest cost of new financings in 1994.

      In November 1993, American endured a five-day strike by its flight
attendants' union; the strike ended when both sides agreed to binding
arbitration.  The arbitration process is expected to be complex and will likely
not be decided for several months.  While the ultimate outcome is uncertain,
the new contract will likely result in higher unit labor costs in 1994.

      American's labor contract with its pilots' union becomes amendable in
August 1994.  The Company and the union leadership are pursuing opportunities
to streamline the negotiation and settlement process.  The ultimate outcome of
these negotiations cannot be estimated at this time.

INFORMATION SERVICES GROUP   The integration of AMR's information services
businesses will continue in 1994 with the integration of American Airlines
Decision Technologies, which is a subsidiary of AMR, SDS and other units in The
SABRE Group into SABRE Decision Technologies (SDT).  SDT will develop and
market The SABRE Group's expanding array of information systems products and
services to a growing list of airline and other customers throughout the world.

      STIN will seek to sustain its revenue growth through continued
geographical expansion of the SABRE computerized reservation system and the
sale of its leading-edge automated reservations products such as SABRExpress,
SABRExpress Ticketing and SABRE TravelBase, a new travel agency accounting
system.
