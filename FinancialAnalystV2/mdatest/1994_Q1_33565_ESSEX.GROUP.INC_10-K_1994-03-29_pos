Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
             Financial Condition 

    Introduction

     The Company is engaged in one principal line of  business, the production
    of electrical wire and cable.  The Company classifies its  operations into
    four major  divisions  based  on  the  markets  served:   Wire  and  Cable
    Division,  Magnet Wire and Insulation Division, Telecommunication Products
    Division  and  Engineered  Products   Division.    See  "Business"  for  a
    description of  the principal  products offered by each  division and  the
    total sales for each major product line for the years ended 1993, 1992 and
    1991.
     
     For  financial  statement  purposes,   the  Acquisition  and  Merger  was
    accounted for by Holdings  as a purchase acquisition  effective October 1,
    1992.  Because the Company is a  wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings,  the
    effects of the Acquisition and Merger have been reflected in the Company's
    financial statements,  resulting in  a new basis  of accounting reflecting
    estimated fair values for Successor's assets and liabilities at that date.
    However,  to  the  extent  that  Holdings'  management  had  a  continuing
    investment  interest in  Holdings'  common stock,  such fair  values  (and
    contributed  stockholder's equity) were reduced proportionately to reflect
    the continuing  interest (approximately 10%) at  the prior historical cost
    basis.  As  a result, the Company's  financial statements for the  periods
    subsequent  to September  30, 1992  are presented  on the  Successor's new
    basis of accounting, while the financial statements for September 30, 1992
    and prior periods are presented on the Predecessor's historical cost basis
    of accounting.  The consolidated results of operations of the  Company for
    the  twelve  month  period  ended  December 31,  1992   are  not  directly
    comparable to the  consolidated results of operations  of the  Predecessor
    due to the effects of  the Acquisition and Merger and related refinancings
    and the concurrent  adoption of FAS 109.   See Notes 1 and  7 of Notes  to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.
     
     In connection with the Acquisition and Merger and the concurrent adoption
    of FAS 109, the Successor recognized $142.2 million of excess of cost over
    net assets acquired that is being amortized over 35  years on the straight
    line method.

    Results of Operations

    The Year Ended December 31, 1993 Compared With The Twelve Months Ended
    December 31, 1992

     Net sales for  1993 were $868.8 million or 4.5% lower  than 1992.  Record
    sales volume in 1993  exceeded the previous record-level volume of 1992 by
    approximately  5.1% but  was more  than offset  by reduced  product prices
    reflecting lower  copper costs, the Company's principal  raw material, and
    competitive  pricing pressures.   Copper costs are generally  passed on to
    customers through  product pricing.  The  average price for copper  on the
    New York Commodity Exchange, Inc. (the "COMEX") declined 17.0% from  1992.
    The  Company believes  the improved sales  volume resulted  from increased
    demand for wire products within the served markets and was attributable to
    an improving economy, especially as it affected the markets  served by the
    Magnet Wire  and Insulation  and  Engineered Products  Divisions.   For  a
    discussion  of  the Company's  practices  with respect  to  the  purchase,
    internal  distribution  and  processing  of  copper, see  "Business-Metals
    Operations." Also  see "General  Economic Conditions  and Inflation" under
    this caption.

     Sales for the Magnet Wire  and Insulation Division were up 5.3%  compared
    to 1992.  Sales  volume increased 12.5% over 1992 resulting from increased
    demand  for magnet  wire products  in the  automotive, electric  motor and
    transformer  markets  in  addition  to  increased  sales to  distributors.
    Product pricing was down approximately 6.9% due primarily to lower  copper
    prices  in  1993  compared  to  1992.   The  Engineered  Products Division
    experienced a 5.3%  increase in sales over 1992 attributable  primarily to
    increased demand for the  division's automotive wire products.  Automotive
    wire volumes increased approximately 21% from 1992 due in part to improved
    demand  from  its  primary customer  and  to several  new  accounts.   See
    "Business-Division  Operations-Engineered  Products  Division".    Of  the
    increased automotive sales volume, 27% resulted from new customers.  Sales
    of non-automotive  products also  experienced volume  improvements despite
    decreased  demand  for pump  and  welding cable  products  resulting  from
    flooding  in  the  midwest  during  1993.     The  Wire  and   Cable,  and
    Telecommunication Products  Divisions experienced  sales declines in  1993
    compared with  1992.  The Wire  and Cable Division's  sales were off 11.3%
    from 1992  due principally  to  lower copper  prices and  reduced  product
    pricing.   Volume  was  down slightly  compared  with 1992  due  mainly to
    selective  market participation during  part of  the year.   Sales  by the
    Telecommunication Products Division were down approximately 11.8% compared
    with 1992.  In addition to reduced  product pricing, unit sales volume  to
    the  domestic telephone markets was down 22.0% partially offset by a 19.3%
    increase  in export  unit  volume.   Product  demand within  the  domestic
    markets was down due primarily to general uncertainty about the economy as
    well as the ongoing restructuring of the U.S. telephone cable industry. 

     Cost  of  goods  sold  decreased  4.4% in  1993  compared  with  1992 due
    primarily to  lower copper prices  partially offset by higher sales volume
    and  additional depreciation  expense  resulting from  the  application of
    purchase accounting in connection with the Acquisition and Merger and  the
    concurrent adoption of FAS 109 (See Notes 1 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements).   The Company's cost of goods sold  as a percentage
    of net sales was  85.8% in each of 1993 and  1992.  The cost of goods sold
    percentage  in 1993  was  adversely  impacted by  generally  lower selling
    prices and additional  depreciation expense resulting from the application
    of purchase accounting  in connection with the Acquisition and  Merger and

                                        16




    the concurrent adoption of FAS 109 partially offset by lower manufacturing
    costs resulting from  increased capacity utilization.  Cost of  goods sold
    in  1992  includes a  charge of  $2.6  million relating  to  planned plant
    consolidations, primarily  costs to  move equipment  and personnel related
    expenses.   Raw material  costs in 1993, excluding  copper, were generally
    unchanged from 1992.  

     Selling and administrative expenses in 1993 were 7.9% lower than 1992 due
    primarily to  the expiration of a  non-compete agreement  with UTC in  the
    first  quarter   1993  resulting  in   the  elimination  of  the   related
    amortization  charge, a  $2.1 million  reduction  in the  Company's health
    insurance expense and a $1.5 million accrual in 1992 for the relocation of
    a business  unit in 1993.   In connection with  the 1988  Acquisition, UTC
    agreed  that until  March 1,  1993, it  would not  engage in  any business
    directly competing with any business carried on by the Company on February
    29, 1988.  The $34.0 million purchase price allocated  to the covenant not
    to compete was amortized over five years on the straight line method.  The
    reduction  in  health  insurance  expense  was  attributable to  favorable
    experience  in health  related expenditures.   Partially  offsetting these
    expense reductions was a $4.0 million amortization charge recorded in 1993
    for  excess of  cost over net  assets acquired compared to  a $1.0 million
    charge recorded in the last quarter of  1992 and a $2.5 million  reduction
    in the  Company's allowance  for doubtful accounts recorded  in the  third
    quarter of  1992.   In  connection with  the  Acquisition and  Merger  and
    concurrent adoption of FAS 109, the Successor recognized $142.2 million of
    excess of  cost over net assets  acquired that is  being amortized over 35
    years on the  straight line method.  The Company's allowance  for doubtful
    accounts  was reduced  on the  basis  of the  collection of  a substantial
    receivable  which had  been considered  doubtful  as well  as management's
    assessment of collection risk in the primary markets served.

     Interest expense in  1993 was $25.2 million as compared  to $22.6 million
    in 1992.    The  increase  was  principally  caused by  $19.0  million  in
    additional weighted  average  debt outstanding  and  an  increase  in  the
    Company's average  interest rate  incurred  (from   8.9%  to 9.7%).    The
    additional debt  outstanding was  primarily  attributable to  Acquisition-
    related borrowings and the May 1993 sale by the Company of  its 10% Senior
    Notes due  2003 (the  "Senior Notes").  Average  interest rates  increased
    reflecting the  higher interest rate on the Senior Notes compared with the
    rate  of interest on the Term Credit which was repaid from the sale of the
    Senior  Notes,  partially  offset  by  the redemption  of  all outstanding
    12 3/8% Senior  Subordinated Debentures due  2000 (the "Debentures") which
    were also repaid in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes.  See
    also "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition".

     In  connection  with the  Acquisition  and  Merger, the  Company incurred
    certain merger related expenses in the amount of $18.1 million  consisting
    primarily of bonus  and option payments to certain employees,  and certain
    merger  fees  and  expenses  which  were  charged  to  operations  of  the
    Predecessor  in the quarter  ended September 30, 1992.   These Acquisition
    and Merger  expenses had the  effect of reducing 1992 net  income by $12.5
    million (after  applicable tax benefit of  $5.6 million).   See Note  1 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Income  tax expense was $13.1 million, or  58.2% of pretax income in 1993
    compared  with $7.4  million, or  95.2%, of  pretax income  in 1992.   The
    Company elected not to  step up its  tax bases in  the assets acquired  in
    either  the  Acquisition  or  the  1988  Acquisition.    Accordingly,  the

                                        17




    Company's income  tax bases in  the assets acquired have  not been changed
    from those prior  to the 1988 Acquisition.  Depreciation  and amortization
    of the higher  allocated financial statement bases are not  deductible for
    income  tax purposes,  thus causing the effective  income tax  rate of the
    Predecessor to  be generally  higher than the combined  federal and  state
    statutory rate.   Because  of the  adoption of FAS 109  by the  Successor,
    concurrent with the Acquisition, deferred  income taxes have been provided
    for bases differences in all  assets and liabilities other  than excess of
    cost  over net  assets acquired.   In compliance  with the  Omnibus Budget
    Reconciliation  Act of 1993,  the Company's tax balances  were adjusted in
    the third quarter of 1993 to reflect the new federal statutory tax rate of
    35%.   The adjustment had  the effect of increasing income  tax expense by
    $2.3 million for 1993 or  10.0% of pretax income.  See  Note 7 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

     The Company  recorded net income of  $6.0 million in 1993  as compared to
    net   income  of  $0.3  million   in  1992.    The  1993  results  include
    extraordinary charges of $3.4 million ($5.5 million before applicable  tax
    benefits) associated with the repayment of the Term Credit and  redemption
    of the Debentures.   See also "Liquidity, Capital Resources  and Financial
    Condition".   The 1992  results include $18.1 million  of Acquisition  and
    Merger related expenses, $12.5 million net of applicable tax benefit,  and
    a  $0.1 million extraordinary  charge ($0.2 million before  applicable tax
    benefit)  resulting  from  the  partial  repurchase of  a  portion  of the
    outstanding Debentures.

    Twelve Months Ended December 31, 1992 Compared With The Year Ended
    December 31, 1991

     Net sales  for 1992 were  $909.4 million  or 2.7% greater  than 1991  due
    principally to a record volume year with an 8.0%  increase in sales volume
    over 1991.   The Company attributes the increase  in sales volume at least
    in part to the strengthening U.S. economy during the period.  The positive
    effects of an increase in sales volumes were partially offset, however, by
    lower copper prices, the Company's principal raw material, and competitive
    product  pricing.   Copper  costs  are generally  passed on  to  customers
    through product  pricing and  the average price  for copper  on the  COMEX
    declined  2.1%  from  1991.    Due  to  increased  competitive  pressures,
    primarily in the building wire and  telecommunication cable product lines,
    overall  product pricing was below 1991  levels.  For a  discussion of the
    Company's practices  with respect  to the  purchase, internal distribution
    and  processing of  copper, see  "Business Metals  Operations."   Also see
    "General Economic Conditions and Inflation" under this caption.

     The Wire and Cable Division's sales, after reflecting the transfer to the
    Engineered  Products   Division  of   an  industrial   wire  product  line
    representing $32.7 million in sales in 1992, declined 3.1% from 1991 sales
    levels.  Despite such product line transfer, Wire and Cable Division sales
    volume was nearly 4.7% ahead of 1991  due to improved demand for  building
    wire products.  Sales for the division would have increased 5.8% and sales
    volume would  have increased  10.9% in 1992  over 1991  had the industrial
    wire  product  line  transfer  occurred  on  January 1,  1991.   Increased
    competitive  pressures in the  fourth quarter of 1992,  however, caused an
    overall deterioration  in product  pricing  for the  year.   Sales  volume
    during the fourth  quarter was essentially unchanged from the  same period
    in 1991.   The Magnet Wire and  Insulation Division's sales increased 2.7%
    over  1991 due primarily to a 7.5% improvement in sales volume.  Increased
    automobile and truck  production coupled with an upturn in  housing starts

                                        18




    contributed  to the higher  volumes.  Magnet Wire  and Insulation Division
    product pricing declined marginally from 1991.  Telecommunication Products
    Division  sales were  off  5.5%  from  1991  levels.    During  1992,  the
    Telecommunication   Products  Division  experienced  more  severe  pricing
    pressures in its domestic markets and therefore, diverted a larger portion
    of  its manufacturing  capacity to  serve  export markets.   Consequently,
    export sales for the division were up 111.4% from 1991.  Due to the change
    in product mix  and continued pricing pressures, average Telecommunication
    Products  Division   product  pricing   declined  moderately  from   1991.
    Engineered  Products  Division's  sales were  up  $37.1 million  from 1991
    although $32.7 million  of that increase was attributable to  the transfer
    from the  Wire and  Cable Division  of the  industrial wire  product line.
    Without  giving effect  to that  transfer, sales  were up  6.2% due  to an
    increase in  automotive and  industrial wire sales volumes.   A  generally
    improved  economy  coupled  with  an  approximate  8.9%  rise in  domestic
    automobile and  truck production  were the  primary  contributors to  this
    improvement.

     Cost  of goods  sold in 1992  increased 3.6%  from 1991  due primarily to
    higher sales volume  partially offset by lower copper costs  and generally
    lower other material costs.  The Company's cost of goods sold as a percent
    of net sales was 85.8% and 85.0% in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The cost
    of  goods sold  percentage in  1992 was  higher than  in 1991  because the
    Company's  major business  units experienced  greater  competitive pricing
    pressure  resulting in generally  lower selling prices.   The higher sales
    volume,  however,  lead to  increased  capacity  utilization  resulting in
    generally  lower manufacturing costs.  Cost of goods sold in 1992 was also
    impacted by a charge of approximately $2.6 million to reflect  anticipated
    plant  consolidations  and   approximately  $1.6  million   in  additional
    depreciation  expense resulting from  the October  1, 1992  application of
    purchase accounting in connection with the Acquisition and Merger and  the
    concurrent adoption of FAS 109 on a prospective basis.

     Selling and administrative  expenses for 1992 were up  2.2% from 1991 but
    remained  at approximately 9.0%  of sales.  Contributing  to this increase
    was  a $1.5  million accrual in  1992 for the anticipated  relocation of a
    business  unit  in 1993  and a  $1.0 million  amortization charge  for the
    excess cost over  net assets acquired associated with the  Acquisition and
    Merger and  adoption of  FAS 109.   A  reduction of  $2.5  million in  the
    Company's allowance for doubtful accounts and a $1.0 million reduction  in
    its health insurance accrual  in 1992 offset  the foregoing charges.   The
    Company's allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by $2.5 million (net
    $1.8 million after  approximately $0.7  million current provision)  on the
    basis  of  the  collection  of  a substantial  receivable  which  had been
    considered  doubtful  as  well  as  management's  assessment  of  risk  of
    collection  in the  primary markets  served.   In addition,  actual health
    related   expenditures  did   not  increase   to  the   levels  previously
    anticipated.    The 1991  results include  a charge  for a  warranty claim
    settlement of approximately $1.7 million.

     Interest expense in  1992 was $22.6 million as  compared to $25.0 million
    in  1991.   This 9.5%  decrease was  due principally  to  a $17.5  million
    reduction in the Company's weighted average total  debt outstanding during
    1992 and  generally lower  interest  rates on  the Company's  bank  credit
    facilities.   During  1992, Debenture  Repurchases totalled  $13.8 million
    while the  Company's weighted  average interest  rate on  debt outstanding
    declined from  10.4%  to  8.7%.    Partially  offsetting  these  favorable
    outcomes was  an amortization  charge related to the  deferred debt  costs

                                        19




    incurred  to place the  new credit agreement and  amortization of deferred
    debt  costs on  debt retired  and  to be  retired  in connection  with the
    Acquisition.  See "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition."

     In  connection with  the  Acquisition  and Merger,  the Company  incurred
    certain merger related expenses in the amount of $18.1 million  consisting
    primarily of bonus  and option payments to certain employees,  and certain
    merger  fees  and  expenses  which  were  charged  to  operations  of  the
    Predecessor in the  quarter ended September 30, 1992.   These  Acquisition
    and Merger expenses had the effect of reducing net income by $12.5 million
    (after applicable tax  benefit of $5.6 million).   See Note 1 of  Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Income tax  expense was $7.4 million,  or 95.2% of pretax  income in 1992
    compared with  $13.2 million,  or 47.7%,  of pretax income in  1991.   The
    Company elected not  to step up its  tax bases in  the assets acquired  in
    either  the  Acquisition  or  the  1988  Acquisition.    Accordingly,  the
    Company's income  tax bases in  the assets acquired have  not been changed
    from those prior  to the 1988 Acquisition.  Depreciation  and amortization
    of the higher  allocated financial statement bases are not  deductible for
    income tax  purposes, thus  causing the effective income  tax rate  of the
    Predecessor Company to be generally higher than the  approximate statutory
    rate of 39%.   Because of the adoption of FAS 109 by the Successor Company
    concurrent with the Acquisition,  deferred income taxes have been provided
    for bases differences in all assets  and liabilities other than  excess of
    cost over net assets acquired.  See Notes 2 and 7 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

     The Company's net  income for the twelve month  period ended December 31,
    1992 (after  giving effect  to  $18.1 million  of Acquisition  and  Merger
    related  expenses, $12.5 million  net of applicable tax  benefit) was $0.3
    million which included a $0.1 million ($0.2 million before applicable  tax
    benefit) extraordinary charge resulting from Debenture Repurchases.

    Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition

     The Company had  a ratio of debt  (consisting of current and  non-current
    portions of  long-term debt) to stockholder's  equity of approximately 0.7
    to 1 at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

     In connection with the Acquisition and Merger, the Company entered into a
    credit agreement in  September 1992, among BE, the Company,  Holdings, the
    lenders  named  therein   and  Chemical   Bank,  as  agent   (the  "Credit
    Agreement").   Under the  Credit Agreement,  the Company  borrowed  $130.0
    million  in term loans (the "Term Credit") of which $94.0 million was used
    to repay  all indebtedness outstanding under the Company's previous credit
    agreement and the  balance was used to pay  a portion of the consideration
    payable to  Holdings' shareholders  and option holders in  the Merger  and
    certain  fees and  expenses  of the  Company and  Holdings related  to the
    Acquisition  and Merger  and for  other general  corporate purposes.   The
    Credit  Agreement also  provided for  $155.0  million in  revolving credit
    expiring April 9, 1998. 

     In May 1993, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount
    of its Senior Notes.  The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the
    Senior Notes, after underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering
    expenses,  were  approximately   $193.5  million.    The  Company  applied
    approximately $111.0 million of such proceeds to the repayment of the Term

                                        20




    Credit and in June 1993 applied the balance of such proceeds together with
    new borrowings  of approximately  $7.5 million under  the revolving credit
    facility  of the amended  and restated  credit agreement  (see immediately
    following  paragraph), to redeem  all of its outstanding  Debentures.  The
    Company recognized extraordinary charges in the second quarter of 1993  of
    approximately $3.4  million ($5.5  million before  applicable tax benefit)
    associated with  the repayment  of the Term  Credit and  redemption of the
    Debentures.

     Upon  application of the  net proceeds received from  the Senior Notes to
    repay the Term Credit, as discussed above, an amendment and restatement of
    the Credit  Agreement became effective  (the "Restated Credit Agreement").
    The  Restated Credit  Agreement provides for  $175.0 million  in revolving
    credit,  subject to specified  percentages of eligible assets,  reduced by
    outstanding letters  of credit  (the "Revolving  Credit").   The Revolving
    Credit expires in 1998.  Revolving Credit loans bear interest at  floating
    rates at bank prime rate  plus 1.25% or a reserve adjusted Eurodollar rate
    (LIBOR) plus 2.25%.   The effective interest rate can be reduced  by 0.25%
    to  0.75% if  certain specified  financial conditions  are achieved.   The
    Company has  purchased interest rate cap  protection through 1994 covering
    up  to $100.0 million of Revolving Credit borrowings.  No term facility is
    available under the Restated Credit Agreement.  Through December 31, 1993,
    the Company fully complied  with all of the financial ratios and covenants
    contained in the  Restated Credit Agreement and the indenture  under which
    the Senior Notes were issued (the "Indenture").

     The Restated Credit Agreement and the Indenture contain provisions  which
    may restrict  the liquidity of the Company.  These include restrictions on
    the incurrence of additional indebtedness and, in the case of the Restated
    Credit  Agreement,  mandatory  principal repayment  requirements  for  all
    indebtedness  that exceeds the  Borrowing Base as defined  in the Restated
    Credit Agreement.

     Net cash provided  by operating activities in 1993  was $60.7 million, an
    increase of $27.2  million over  1992.   Cash flow  provided by  operating
    activities in 1993,  together with borrowings under  the revolving  credit
    facility  of the Credit  Agreement and the Restated  Credit Agreement were
    sufficient  to  meet the  Company's  cash  interest  requirements, working
    capital  and capital  expenditure needs  and  to  pay mandatory  principal
    payments  on  the  Term  Credit  portion  of  the  Credit  Agreement.   As
    previously discussed, the  Term Credit was repaid in  full in May 1993 out
    of proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Senior Notes.

     Capital expenditures in 1993 were $26.2 million or $5.0 million less than
    in  1992.   Such expenditures  included $2.6  and $9.2  million for  a new
    magnet wire manufacturing facility in Franklin, Indiana in 1993 and  1992,
    respectively.   This new  facility is  occupied by  both the  Company  and
    Femco.   Femco  was established  in 1988  as a  joint venture  between the
    Company  and  The  Furukawa  Electric  Company, Ltd.,  Tokyo,  Japan.   At
    December  31, 1993,  approximately $8.6  million was committed  to outside
    vendors for  capital projects  to expand  capacity, complete modernization
    projects,  reduce costs  and ensure  continued compliance  with regulatory
    provisions.  Capital expenditures in 1994 are expected to approximate 1993
    spending  levels.   In  November  1993, the  Company acquired  a  majority
    interest in Interstate Industries, Inc. for cash of $4.3 million,  subject
    to final  purchase price  adjustments and the  minority interest ownership
    percentage.   See "Business--Business  Development."   The Restated Credit


                                        21




    Agreement imposes  annual limits on the Company's capital expenditures and
    business acquisitions.

     The Company anticipates that its working capital, capital expenditure and
    cash  interest  requirements   for  1994  will  be  satisfied   through  a
    combination  of funds  generated from  operating activities  together with
    funds available under the Revolving Credit.  Management bases such  belief
    on historical experience and the  substantial availability of funds  under
    the Revolving Credit.  Increased working capital needs occur whenever  the
    Company experiences strong incremental demand in its business as well as a
    significant rise in copper prices.  Average quarterly cash flow  generated
    from operations  for the  three year  period ended  December 31,  1993 was
    $13.7 million; at December 31, 1993 the entire $175.0 million of Revolving
    Credit was available, subject to specified percentages of eligible assets,
    (less $13.9  million in  outstanding  letters of  credit).   During  1993,
    average borrowings  under the  Company's revolving  credit facilities were
    $10.1 million  compared to  $66.8 million  during 1992.   In 1993  certain
    pension actuarial  assumptions were  revised to reflect  changes in  their
    underlying economic  fundamentals.   The effect of such  revisions on  the
    Company's results of operations and cash flows for 1994 is not expected to
    be material.

     The  Company expects  that  it may  also  make certain  cash  payments to
    Holdings  or other  affiliates from  time to  time to  the extent  cash is
    available and to  the extent it is permitted to  do so under the  terms of
    the  Restated Credit  Agreement  and  the Indenture.   Such  payments  may
    include  (i) an amount  necessary under the tax  sharing agreement between
    the Company and Holdings to enable Holdings to pay  the Company's taxes as
    if  computed on  an  unconsolidated basis;  (ii)  a management  fee  to an
    affiliate  of BHLP  of up  to $1.0  million; (iii)  amounts  to repurchase
    outstanding Senior Discount Debentures due 2004 of Holdings (the "Holdings
    Debentures") to the extent they may become available for repurchase in the
    open market at prices  which Holdings and the Company find attractive  and
    to  the extent  such  repurchases are  permitted  under the  terms  of the
    instruments governing  Holdings and  the Company's  indebtedness; and (iv)
    other amounts  to meet  ongoing  expenses of  Holdings (such  amounts  are
    considered  to be immaterial both individually and in  the aggregate).  To
    the extent  the Company  makes any  such payments,  it will  do so out  of
    operating cash flow or borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement  and
    only to  the extent such payments  are permitted  under the  terms of  the
    Restated  Credit Agreement  and  the  Indenture.   Each of  the  foregoing
    payments is either completely discretionary on the part  of the Company or
    may be waived by an affiliate of the Company.

     Notwithstanding  any of the foregoing payments which the Company may make
    to Holdings,  Holdings' actual liquidity  requirements are expected to  be
    insubstantial in 1994  on an unconsolidated basis because Holdings  has no
    operations (other than those  conducted through the Company)  or employees
    and is not expected to have any tax liability  on an unconsolidated basis.
    Holdings' Series  A Cumulative  Redeemable  Exchangeable Preferred  Stock,
    Liquidation Preference  $25 Per  Share (the  "Series A  Preferred Stock"),
    which was issued  in connection with the Acquisition and  Merger, provides
    that  dividends may be paid  in kind at the option  of Holdings until 1998
    and is  not subject  to mandatory redemption until  2004 (except  upon the
    occurrence  of certain specified events).  The redemption price is $25 per
    share plus  accrued and unpaid dividends  to the date  of redemption.  For
    the year ended  December 31, 1993  Holdings recorded dividends in  kind of
    $5.2 million.   The  Restated  Credit Agreement  permits Holdings  to  pay

                                        22




    dividends  in cash  on the  Series A  Preferred  Stock subject  to certain
    limitations.  However, in the near term, Holdings expects to pay dividends
    on  the Series A Preferred Stock in additional  shares of such stock.  The
    Holdings Debentures are  not expected to have  an impact on  the Company's
    liquidity prior  to November  15,  1995 (unless  they are  repurchased  or
    refinanced  prior to that date)  when cash interest at 16.0% first becomes
    payable semi-annually.   The Holdings Debentures were issued in  May 1989.
    As of December 31, 1993,  Holdings had a liability, net of repurchases, of
    $228.9  million in  respect  of the  Holdings Debentures  ($277.8  million
    aggregate  principal  amount).   Through  December  31, 1993  Holdings had
    repurchased  $64.2  million aggregate  principal  amount  of  its Holdings
    Debentures  in the open  market using cash dividends,  management fees and
    income taxes paid to Holdings by the Company together with available cash.
    Such payments were  made pursuant to the Company's prior  credit agreement
    which was terminated October  9, 1992.  There have been no  repurchases of
    Holdings Debentures  since 1991  and further repurchases, if  any, may  be
    made at the discretion of Holdings and will depend upon market conditions,
    and,  in particular,  the  prices  at which  the Holdings  Debentures  are
    trading as well as Holdings' available  cash.  The Holdings Debentures are
    unsecured  debt  of  Holdings  and  are  effectively  subordinated to  all
    outstanding indebtedness of the  Company, including the Senior  Notes, and
    will be effectively subordinated to other indebtedness incurred  by direct
    and indirect subsidiaries of Holdings, if issued.

     Because  Holdings  is a  holding  company  with  no  operations  and  has
    virtually  no assets  other  than  the outstanding  capital stock  of  the
    Company  (all of which is pledged to the lenders under the Restated Credit
    Agreement),  Holdings'  ability  to  meet  its cash  obligations  will  be
    dependent  upon  the  Company's  ability to  pay  dividends,  loan  or  to
    otherwise  advance or transfer  funds to  Holdings in  sufficient amounts.
    The Company believes that the Restated Credit Agreement and the  Indenture
    permit the  Company to dividend or otherwise provide funds  to Holdings to
    enable Holdings  to meet  its  known cash  obligations provided  that  the
    Company meets certain  conditions.   Among such  conditions, however,  are
    that the Company meet  various financial maintenance tests.   There can be
    no assurance that such tests will  be met, in which case the Company would
    not  be able  to pay  dividends to  Holdings without  the  consent of  the
    percentage  of the  lenders  specified  in the  Restated  Credit Agreement
    and/or  the holders of the percentage of the Senior Notes specified in the
    Indenture.   There can be  no assurance that the Company  would be able to
    obtain such  consents, or meet the  terms on which  such consents might be
    granted if  they were obtainable.   Moreover, a violation  of the Restated
    Credit Agreement and/or the  Indenture could lead to  an event of  default
    and  acceleration of  outstanding indebtedness  under the  Restated Credit
    Agreement  and to  acceleration  of the  indebtedness represented  by  the
    Senior Notes and  the Holdings Debentures.   Because the capital  stock of
    the Company and  its subsidiaries, as well as  virtually all of the assets
    of  the Company and its subsidiaries, are pledged to the lenders under the
    Restated Credit  Agreement, such  lenders  would have  a claim  over  such
    assets  prior to holders of  the Senior Notes and the Holdings Debentures.
    In the event Holdings were unable to meet its cash obligations, a sequence
    of events similar to that described above could ultimately occur.

    General Economic Conditions and Inflation

     The  Company  faces  various  economic  risks ranging  from  an  economic
    downturn  adversely  impacting the  Company's  primary  markets  to marked
    fluctuations in copper  prices.  In the short-term, pronounced  changes in

                                        23




    the price  of copper tend to  affect the Wire  and Cable  Division's gross
    profits because such  changes affect raw material costs more  quickly than
    those  changes  can be  reflected  in the  pricing of  the Wire  and Cable
    Division's products.  In the long-term, however, copper price changes have
    not  had a material adverse  effect on gross profits  because cost changes
    generally  have been passed through  to customers over time.  In addition,
    the  Company believes  that its  sensitivity to  downturns in  its primary
    markets is less significant than  it might otherwise be due to its diverse
    customer base and its strategy of attempting to match its copper purchases
    with its needs.  During 1993, the Company experienced general  improvement
    in most of its markets served coinciding with general economic conditions.
    The  Company cannot predict  either the  continuation of  current economic
    conditions or future results of its operations in light thereof.

     The  Company believes that  it is not particularly  affected by inflation
    except to  the extent  that the  economy in general  is thereby  affected.
    Should  inflationary pressures  drive costs  higher, the  Company believes
    that general industry  competitive price increases would sustain operating
    results, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
