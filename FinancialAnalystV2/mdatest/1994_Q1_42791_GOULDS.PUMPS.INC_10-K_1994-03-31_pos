ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


Management's discussion and analysis reviews the Company's operating results for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, and its financial
condition at December 31, 1993.  The focus of this review is on the underlying
business reasons for significant changes and trends affecting our sales, net
earnings, and financial condition.  This review should be read in conjunction
with the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the related Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Five-Year Summary of Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

1993 was a year in which the pump industry as a whole continued to be impacted
by weak economic conditions and increased competitive pricing pressures.  Goulds
Pumps' 1993 sales were slightly below 1992 levels, and earnings for the year of
$1.12 from continuing operations were 8.2% lower than last year's $1.22 from
continuing operations, exclusive of 1992 restructuring charges ($.19 per share)
and 7.7% above last year's $1.04 in earnings before the cumulative effect of the
accounting changes.  The decrease from 1992's $1.22 earnings level is
attributable to a consolidated gross margin decline of nearly three percentage
points caused by stiff price competition in key markets and lower fourth quarter
sales at EPD due to the implementation of CATS II, a new systems-driven
manufacturing process.  These declines were partially offset by a decrease in
selling, general and administrative costs resulting from cost control measures
and favorability in the translation of WTG-Europe's (Lowara) expenses, an
outstanding performance by our joint venture, Oil Dynamics, Inc., and the tax
benefits of the European corporate restructuring and other tax strategies. 
Reported 1993 earnings per share of $1.07 reflect the recording as of January 1,
1993 of the cumulative effect of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard
No. 112 (SFAS No. 112), "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,"
which had a $.05 impact.

1993 orders of $558.4 million were down slightly from 1992's record orders level
of $560.1 million.  Industrial Products Group (IPG) orders decreased 2.4% while
Water Technologies Group (WTG) orders increased 2.6%.  Fourth quarter 1993 order
activity was 8.6% above 1992's fourth quarter, as both IPG and WTG experienced
order level upturns.  The Company is hopeful that the fourth quarter results are
an indication of the beginning of a stronger orders trend into 1994.

IPG experienced a softening of pump order activity in 1993 as customers in key
core markets continued to defer spending for major projects.  IPG repair parts
activity increased slightly over 1992 levels due largely to energy-industry
repair business offsetting the negative impact of selective union strikes
against coal producers which affected the demand for slurry product repair 
parts during most of 1993.  These strikes were settled during the fourth quarter
of 1993.

Within WTG, WTG-America's (WTG-A) 1993 orders levels increased 12.2% compared to
1992, while orders at WTG-Europe declined 10.3% on a translated basis.  On a
local currency basis, WTG-Europe's 1993 orders increased 14.4% over 1992,
primarily due to new product introductions, marketing initiatives, and the 
impact of the weaker lira, which makes Lowara's products more price competitive.
WTG-A orders increased due the impact of new product promotions and to dry U.S. 
weather conditions in the Northeast and South.

1993 was a year of many challenges as well as many accomplishments.  Highlights
of the year include:

*       The acquisition of Environamics Corporation.  Goulds' investment in
        Environamics reflects the Company's continuing commitment to be the 
        leader in advancing state-of-the-art pump design.  The Company believes
        the Environamics pumps will qualify as the best available technology to
        control chemical emissions and expects demand for the pumps to increase
        as manufacturing plants respond to requirements of OSHA and the Clean 
        Air Act.  Sales of the Environamics product line could reach $40 million
        by the late 1990s.

*       During 1993, the Company's two largest divisions, the Engineered 
        Products Division (EPD) and WTG-America implemented phase II of CATS - 
        Competitive Advantage Through Simplification.  This is a systems-driven


                                     Page 15 of 54

        overhaul of how the Company operates, from customer inquiries to order 
        entry to shipment.  While it will take several months for all aspects 
        of these newest introductions of CATS to fully significant improvements
        are expected in the Company's ability to deliver products efficiently 
        to customers in 1994 and beyond.  

*       During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company substantially completed
        personnel reductions in IPG and on the Corporate staff that will result
        in future cost savings in excess of $4.0 million annually.  The Company
        recognized approximately $1.3 million in severance costs associated with
        this downsizing in 1993.

*       The Company continued to expand its international focus and presence as
        WTG-Europe (Lowara) has established a new subsidiary in France, and will
        look to add locations during 1994.  In 1994, the Company expects to
        continue the trend toward international growth through increased sales
        presence in the Asia-Pacific region, South America, and Europe.

*       The Company implemented several tax planning strategies which resulted
        in a decreased effective tax rate in 1993.  A significant one-time 
        adjustment due to tax code changes and the application of SFAS No. 109
        as well as the implementation of the European corporate tax 
        restructuring, were primarily responsible for the rate decrease in 1993.
        Several of the strategies put in place in 1993 are expected to yield 
        future tax benefits.

*       The energy-industry product line, which the Company acquired in 1992,
        exceeded 1993 expectations in terms of profitability, primarily due to
        strong repair parts shipment activity and cost containment measures. 
        The Company anticipates the commencement of energy pump shipments during
        1994.

*       The outstanding performance of the 50%-owned joint venture, Oil 
        Dynamics, Inc. (ODI), had a major impact on 1993's results.  ODI 
        benefitted from the strength of significant Russian business during
        1993.

*       Safety performance in 1993 again showed continuous improvement as the
        Company's employees incurred the lowest number of accidents on record
        within Goulds in a one-year period.  Safety improvements over the 
        past two years have resulted in lower Worker's Compensation insurance 
        premiums for 1994.

Net Sales

The decrease in total sales of $3.2 million in 1993 compared to 1992 is
primarily composed of a $6.0 million or 1.9% decrease in Industrial Products
Group sales while Water Technologies Group sales increased $2.8 million or
1.2%.  IPG sales were impacted by shipment delays early in the fourth quarter
of 1993, caused by the implementation of CATS II at the Engineered Products
Division (EPD).  We expect that it will take a number of months before we are
able to reduce this current shipment backlog.  For WTG, WTG-America sales
increased 10.0% for 1993 compared to 1992 as new products and dry U.S. weather
conditions in the Northeast and South boosted sales.  WTG-Europe (Lowara)
sales for 1993 were 10.3% below 1992 on a translated basis.  On a local
currency basis, sales for the year increased 14.4% over 1992 due to the
shipment of new products and marketing initiatives, as well as the weakening
of the lira, which makes Italian products more price competitive.  Although
affecting Lowara's translated results, the weakening of the lira does not
negatively impact overall WTG profitability due to a natural hedge that exists
since U.S. division imports of Lowara product equal or exceed Lowara's
profitability.

In 1994, IPG expects sales growth internationally and through our increased
presence in the $3 billion worldwide energy market due to the 1992 acquisition
of energy pump lines from the IDP joint venture, which are now produced by
EPD.  The introduction of the Environamics product lines in late 1994 will
further strengthen the Company's competitive position in the chemical market. 

WTG will continue to focus on the development and introduction of new products
and expanding and improving existing product lines.  Additionally, WTG-Europe
is continuing to expand its European presence by establishing a subsidiary in
France and other European locations.  These expansions are expected to result
in sales growth in the future and increased market penetration in key regions. 
WTG-America expects to introduce new products during the second and third
quarters of 1994 in an effort to gain additional market share.  Sales growth
is therefore expected for 1994.

                                    Page 17 of 54

During 1992, net sales of $558.9 million represented a decrease of $7.7
million or 1.4% compared to 1991.  In 1992, IPG sales decreased due to lower
repair parts order activity while WTG sales increased $1.0 million primarily
due to translation favorability at WTG-Europe.


Costs and Expenses

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 28.1% for 1993, compared to
31.0% for 1992.  The Industrial Products Group gross profit percentage for
1993 decreased to 27.5% from 31.0% a year ago.  This decrease is largely
attributable to the continued competitive pricing environment in the U.S. and
certain international markets and a shipments delay of approximately $9
million early in the fourth quarter at EPD due to the implementation of CATS
II.  We expect that it will take a number of months before we are able to
reduce this current shipment backlog.  The Water Technologies Group gross
profit percentage decreased to 29.6% in 1993, compared to 32.0% for 1992. 
This decrease is due in large part to pricing pressure and unfavorable product
shipment mix.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 20.7%, 21.4%, and
20.4% of net sales in 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.  The decrease in
1993 was a result of cost containment measures implemented by the Company,
which included restructuring and workforce reductions.  Also reducing reported
SG&A in 1993 is the favorability associated with the translation of WTG-Europe
expenses.

During 1993, the Company's investment in research and development (R&D) was
$7.2 million, compared to $7.9 million in 1992, and $6.1 million in 1991.  The
higher level of R&D expenses in 1992 relates to the introduction of the SSV
vertical multi-stage product line during the second quarter of 1992 by WTG-
Europe.  In 1994, the Company expects to increase its investment in new
product development as well as in enhancements to existing products in order
to improve its competitive position in the industry.  The acquisition of
Environamics Corporation and the expansion into the energy market provide the
Company with new products to offer customers in the chemical and energy
marketplaces.


Other Income and Expenses

Interest expense increased $.4 million due to the higher levels of short-term
and long-term debt being maintained in 1993 in comparison to 1992.  Interest
expense in 1994 is anticipated to be higher as the Company has drawn down on
a previously arranged long-term financing agreement at a higher interest rate
(see Liquidity and Capital Resources).

Earnings from investments and affiliates increased $3.9 million in 1993
compared to the same period in 1992.  This increase is due to Goulds' share
of the 1993 earnings of Oil Dynamics, Inc. (ODI), a 50%-owned joint venture,
which posted a $3.8 million increase when compared to 1992 results, reflecting
the strength of significant Russian business that will continue into the first
quarter of 1994.  Currently, due to the suspension of Russian financing
availability, further ODI shipments to Russia have been halted.  Though prior
suspensions have been relatively short in duration, the end date of this
suspension cannot be predicted.

The variations in other (income) expense-net in 1992 as compared to 1991 were
primarily the result of non-recurring income in 1991 from the receipt of
government subsidies related to prior year capital expenditures by WTG-Europe.

The provision for income taxes represents 31.5%, 39.0%, and 39.0% of earnings
from continuing operations before income taxes in 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.  In 1993, our effective tax rate decreased due to a third
quarter cumulative adjustment associated with recent tax code changes and new
accounting rules for income taxes (SFAS No. 109) and the implementation of the
corporate European tax restructuring in the fourth quarter.  The effective tax
rate in 1994 is expected to be 38.5%, reflecting the higher marginal tax rates
enacted, less other tax reduction strategies put into place.


                                    Page 18 of 54

Return on Equity

The percentage return on average shareholders' equity in 1993 increased to
12.4% from 9.6% in 1992.  The percentage in 1992 reflects the impact of
restructuring charges.  Excluding the after-tax effects of the restructuring
charge, the 1992 return on average shareholders' equity would have been 11.1%. 
The increase in 1993 reflects the reductions in shareholders' equity caused
by the $12.3 million decrease in cumulative translation adjustments on the
consolidated balance sheet and an increase in the level of after-tax earnings
from continuing operations, primarily due to the tax restructuring strategy. 


Non-recurring Charges

*       Restructuring Charge.  During 1992, the Company recorded the impact of
        a restructuring program designed to reduce costs, improve operating
        efficiencies, and increase shareholder value.  The program included
        $2.9 million related to the early retirement of employees.  In
        addition, $3.4 million resulted from the relocation of certain product
        lines and the centralization of contract engineering for high-
        specification products to better meet customer requirements.  The
        aggregate restructuring program costs are shown as a separate line item
        in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings and resulted in
        an after-tax charge of $3.9 million ($.19 per share) in 1992.  The
        actions considered in the restructuring charge were essentially
        completed during 1993.  The Company began in 1993 to realize the
        benefits associated with this restructuring through reduced payroll-
        related costs and improved operating efficiencies.  A successful
        transfer of the industrial sump pump line (Model 3171) from the
        Lubbock, Texas, facility to the Slurry Pump Division in Ashland,
        Pennsylvania, was also accomplished.

*       Environmental Provision.  In 1991, the Company recorded a $2.0 million
        provision for estimated environmental costs.  This charge reflects
        anticipated costs to monitor and remediate an inactive Company landfill
        site in Seneca Falls, New York.  At December 31, 1993, the remaining
        reserve was $1.7 million.  The remediation is expected to occur through
        late 1995 or early 1996, and the Company does not currently expect any
        additional material expenses in future years associated with this site.

*       Extraordinary Charge.  In 1991, an extraordinary charge net of tax
        benefits of $.6 million was recognized for the early retirement of the
        Company's Convertible Subordinated Debentures.  The $25.0 million of
        Debentures carried an interest rate of 9- 7/8% and were due in the year
        2006.  This one-time charge was fully recovered during 1992 as we
        refinanced the debt at substantially lower interest rates.


Orders and Backlog

In 1993, orders received were $558.4 million, less than 1% below the record
1992 orders level of $560.1 million.  Backlog levels at December 31, 1993,
increased from 1992 by $3.2 million or 3.3% to $100.0 million, primarily due
to the high level of fourth quarter orders activity and the delays in EPD 
shipments caused by the CATS II implementation.  Backlog exists primarily in
the Industrial Products Group as the Water Technologies Group maintains
minimal backlog levels since its products are normally shipped within two
weeks from receipt of a customer order.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

As reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the $20.9 million
of cash generated by operating activities and $10.9 million of cash provided
by net financing activities in 1993, combined with a negative $2.0 million
translation effect, was utilized to fund $36.3 million of net investing
activities, while decreasing cash and cash equivalents by $6.5 million.






                                    Page 19 of 54

Significant items impacting cash flows from operating activities in 1993
include an $18.3 million increase in trade receivables due largely to
increased December shipments volume over 1992 at both IPG and WTG and a $12.5
million increase in inventories primarily at WTG-America and WTG-Europe to
support higher shipment levels and the promotion of new products.

Capital additions in 1993 were $24.7 million, which approximated depreciation
of $24.8 million.  Significant projects included investments in the CATS II
business systems hardware and software upgrades at EPD and equipment additions
at domestic locations.  In 1994, the Company expects to spend approximately
$25-30 million in capital additions.  The 1994 spending level includes
continued major investments in upgrades of machinery and equipment and product
development related expenditures that include the new Environamics technology.

In the third quarter of 1993, WTG-Europe entered into an agreement whereby 10
billion lire ($6.1 million) of proceeds from short-term loans were invested
in insurance certificates.  The net effect of this transaction is to increase
WTG-Europe's interest expense and interest income, resulting in increased
profit after taxes due to tax rate differentials on these items.

Cash flows from investing activities in 1992 reflected the availability of
sinking funds, previously restricted and classified as other long-term assets
related to Industrial Revenue Bond proceeds.

Debt levels at the end of 1993 increased significantly compared to those at
December 31, 1992 primarily due to higher levels of inventory and other
working capital items.  Based on a financing agreement entered into in
December 1992, the Company borrowed $20.0 million on August 3, 1993 at a fixed
interest rate of 7.18% payable semi-annually.  Principal payments are required
in equal annual installments at the end of the third through seventh years. 
Proceeds from this loan were used to refinance a $10.0 million Term Loan due
in August 1993 and other short-term debt.  Additionally, the Company currently
intends to replace its $30 million Revolving Credit Agreement, which will
expire on October 31, 1994.  The Company believes cash from operations and the
$56.1 million of available credit facilities at December 31, 1993, will be
sufficient to meet its liquidity needs during 1994.

Cumulative translation adjustments on the consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 1993 decreased shareholders' equity by $12.3 million from
December 31, 1992 reflecting the weakening of the devalued Italian lira and
the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar since the fourth quarter of 1992.

In 1993, the Company redeemed the rights issued under the Stockholder Rights
Plan instituted in 1988.  The Company paid shareholders a redemption price of
$.01 per share outstanding or approximately $200,000.


Inflation

The market price of a number of the Company's product lines decreased in 1993
due to worldwide competitive pressures in the pump industry.  At the same
time, material cost increases from our vendors have been minimal.  The Company
continues to monitor the impact of inflation in order to minimize its effects
in future years through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and
cost reductions.


Events Impacting Future Operating Results

During 1993, the Company successfully extended its contract for one year with
approximately 80 union employees at the Vertical Products Division, located
in City of Industry, California.  Including California, contracts with four
unions covering approximately 430 employees expire in 1994, the largest being
the 285-member United Steelworkers located at the Slurry Pump Division (SPD)
in Ashland, Pennsylvania.  The Company considers that its overall labor
relations are good with active labor-management committees operating at all
locations.

During the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company announced it acquired
Environamics Corporation, a privately held company whose patented hermetically
sealed pump technology will greatly expand Goulds' ability to help the 


                                    Page 20 of 54

chemical processing industry lower production costs and also meet increasingly
stringent environmental regulations.  Environamics is operating as an
autonomous subsidiary, augmenting Goulds' current industry distribution
channels used by IPG.  Shipments of Environamics products are expected to
begin near the end of the third quarter of 1994.

Financial Officer (CFO).  Mr. Murphy assumed the CFO duties from John M.
Morphy, who continues as Group Vice President of the Industrial Products
Group.

Earnings of our WTG-Europe (Lowara) subsidiary continue to be impacted by
unfavorable currency exchange.  Offsetting this negative impact is the natural
hedge which exists through the transfer of Lowara products to WTG-America. 
We will continue to monitor exchange rate fluctuations and where appropriate,
consider forward contracts for lira purchases to control the impact of these
fluctuations.


Accounting Standards

Effective in the first quarter of 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."  See Note 11 for a
detailed discussion of the impact of this change on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

Effective in the first quarter of 1992, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions"; SFAS
No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments"; and SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."  See Notes 11, 8, and 10, respectively,
for a detailed discussion of the impact of these standards on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.


In Conclusion

The Company is encouraged that it has taken important steps in 1993 that will
yield improved results in 1994 and beyond.  One milestone achieved this year
was the implementation of CATS II and related manufacturing process
improvements, which will translate into increased productivity and better
customer service.  Other important steps have been the acquisition of
Environamics Corporation, the Company's expansion in the energy-industry
business, and cost containment measures that included reducing the workforce. 
These actions, when combined with signs of a stronger orders trend, give the
Company solid reasons for expecting improvement next year in both sales and
profitability.
