ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

                                   OPERATIONS

SALES

    Honeywell's  1993 sales were $5.963 billion, compared with $6.223 billion in
1992 and $6.193 billion in 1991. Both U.S. and international sales declined from
1992. U.S.  sales of  $3.895 billion  were down  3 percent  primarily due  to  a
continuing  cyclical  downturn  in  the Space  and  Aviation  Control commercial
aviation market. International sales, which represent 35 percent of total sales,
declined 6 percent from 1992 to $2.068 billion. The international sales  decline
was  the  result of  negative  currency effects  as  the dollar  strengthened an
average of 9 percent against local currencies in countries where Honeywell  does
business.  This  decline was  partially  offset by  positive  sales growth  of 4
percent measured  in local  currency. U.S.  export sales,  including exports  to
foreign  affiliates, were  $769 million in  1993, compared with  $830 million in
1992 and $808 million in 1991.

COST OF SALES

    Cost of sales was $4.020 billion in 1993, or 67.4 percent of sales, compared
with $4.195 billion (67.4 percent) in 1992 and $4.185 billion (67.6 percent)  in
1991.  Cost as a percentage  of sales remained flat for  1993 during a period of
tough competitive markets  and stagnation  for a majority  of economic  sectors.
Honeywell  remains committed  to efforts to  reduce operating  costs and improve
margins.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

    Honeywell spent  $337 million,  or 5.7  percent of  sales, on  research  and
development  in 1993, compared with $313 million  (5.0 percent) in 1992 and $301
million (4.9 percent) in 1991. Honeywell also received $405 million in funds for
customer-funded research and development in 1993, compared with $390 million  in
1992  and  $373 million  in 1991.  The  higher R&D  percentage in  1993 reflects
significant investments in next-generation technologies. The company expects  to
return to approximately the same rate of R&D spending in 1994 as in 1992.

OTHER EXPENSES AND INCOME

    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.076 billion in 1993, or
18.0  percent of sales, compared with $1.197  billion (19.2 percent) in 1992 and
$1.151 billion  (18.6  percent)  in 1991.  Excluding  royalties  from  autofocus
licensing  agreements  (see Note  3  to Financial  Statements  on page  25), the
percent of sales would have been 18.6 percent and 19.5 percent in 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The higher percentage in  1992 was due to increased  international
selling expenses.

    On  April  16,  1993, Honeywell  announced  the settlement  of  its lawsuits
against the Unisys Corporation and other parties in connection with  Honeywell's
1986  purchase of the Sperry Aerospace  Group. Honeywell received $70 million in
cash and notes, and recorded  a gain of $22 million,  or $14 million ($0.10  per
share)  after income taxes, to offset  previously incurred costs associated with
the matter (see Note 3 to Financial Statements on page 25).

    In April 1987, Honeywell filed suit against Minolta Camera Co. alleging that
Minolta autofocus cameras  infringe Honeywell  patents. Subsequently,  Honeywell
filed  similar  suits  against  other  major  camera  manufacturers  that employ
autofocus technology.  In March  1992,  following a  jury award  in  Honeywell's
favor, Minolta agreed to pay Honeywell $127 million in settlement of the damages
and  Honeywell's claims for interest and legal  fees. In addition to the Minolta
settlement, agreements were reached with various camera manufacturers for  their
use  of Honeywell's patented automatic focus camera technology. The total of all
autofocus settlements recorded, after associated  expenses, was $10 million,  or
$6  million ($0.05 per share)  after income taxes, in  1993 and $288 million, or
$171 million ($1.24 per  share) after income taxes,  in 1992. The pre-tax  gains
from  litigation settlements are included  in litigation settlements and special
charges on the income statement.

                                       11

    Also included in litigation settlements  and special charges are  provisions
for  special charges  of $51  million, or  $29 million  ($0.22 per  share) after
income taxes, in 1993 and $128 million,  or $85 million ($0.62 per share)  after
income taxes, in 1992. The 1993 charges were the result of implementing programs
to  improve  productivity  and  reduce costs  in  each  of  Honeywell's business
segments. Charges in 1992 were made to appropriately size the Space and Aviation
Control business segment to current market conditions and to reposition the Home
and Building Control and Industrial  Control business segments to capitalize  on
emerging  market  opportunities.  The  special  charges  include  provisions for
work-force reductions,  worldwide  facilities consolidation  and  organizational
changes in both 1993 and 1992.

    Net  interest expense was $51  million in 1993, $59  million in 1992 and $61
million in  1991.  In  1992,  Honeywell reduced  total  debt  by  $108  million,
including redemption of high-coupon, long-term debt.

    Earnings   of  companies   owned  20   percent  to   50  percent  (primarily
Yamatake-Honeywell), which are accounted for  using the equity method, were  $18
million in 1993, $16 million in 1992 and $15 million in 1991.

INCOME TAXES

    The  provision for income taxes was $156 million in 1993, compared with $235
million in 1992  and $178  million in  1991. The  enactment by  Congress of  the
Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of 1993,  which  raised  the  U.S. federal
statutory income  tax  rate for  corporations  from  34 percent  to  35  percent
retroactive  to January  1, 1993,  did not  have a  material impact  on the 1993
provision but did result  in the recognition  of a one-time  gain of $9  million
($0.07  per share) in 1993 from the  revaluation of deferred tax assets. Further
information about income taxes is provided in Note 4 to Financial Statements  on
page 25.

EXTRAORDINARY ITEM

    In  1992, Honeywell  recorded an  extraordinary loss  of $14  million, or $9
million ($0.06  per  share)  after income  taxes,  as  a result  of  early  debt
redemptions  that  required  the  payment of  premiums  and  the  recognition of
unamortized discounts and deferred costs.  These redemptions were undertaken  as
part  of Honeywell's  efforts to  reduce its  debt and  manage its interest-rate
exposure.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

    In 1992,  Honeywell adopted  three new  Statements of  Financial  Accounting
Standards.  Statement  of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.  106  (SFAS 106),
"Employers'  Accounting  for  Postretirement  Benefits  Other  Than   Pensions,"
required  recognition of the expected  cost of providing postretirement benefits
over the time employees earn these benefits. Before adopting SFAS 106, Honeywell
recognized the costs  of providing these  benefits on a  pay-as-you-go basis  by
expensing  the cost in the year the  benefit was provided. The cumulative effect
of adopting SFAS 106 at January 1, 1992, was a charge to income of $244 million,
or $151 million ($1.09  per share) after income  taxes. The operating impact  of
adopting SFAS 106 for 1992 was additional expense of $16 million, or $11 million
($0.08 per share) after income taxes.

    Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting
for Income  Taxes," allowed  consideration  of future  events in  assessing  the
likelihood  that  tax  benefits will  be  realized  in future  tax  returns. The
cumulative effect of adopting SFAS  109 at January 1,  1992, was an increase  in
income  of $31 million  ($0.23 per share) resulting  from Honeywell's ability to
recognize additional deferred tax assets.

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (SFAS 112),  "Employers'
Accounting  for Postemployment  Benefits," required  that the  estimated cost of
providing postemployment  benefits  be  recognized  on  an  accrual  basis.  The
cumulative  effect of  adopting SFAS  112 at  January 1,  1992, was  a charge to
income of $40 million, or $25 million ($0.18 per share) after income taxes.  The
operating  impact of  adopting SFAS  112 for 1992  was additional  expense of $4
million, or $2 million ($0.02 per share) after income taxes.

                                       12

NET INCOME

    Honeywell's net income was $322 million ($2.40 per share) in 1993,  compared
with  $247 million ($1.78 per share) in  1992 and $331 million ($2.35 per share)
in 1991.  Net  income  in  1993  includes  an  after-tax  gain  from  litigation
settlements,  after associated  expenses, of $20  million ($0.15  per share); an
after-tax provision for special charges of $29 million ($0.22 per share); and  a
gain  of  $9 million  ($0.07 per  share)  from the  revaluation of  deferred tax
assets.  Net  income  in  1992  includes  an  after-tax  gain  from   litigation
settlements,  after associated expenses,  of $171 million  ($1.24 per share); an
after-tax provision for  special charges of  $85 million ($0.62  per share);  an
extraordinary  loss after income taxes of $9  million ($0.06 per share) from the
early redemption of long-term debt; and  an after-tax reduction of $145  million
($1.04 per share) for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. Net income in
1992  also  included  the operating  impact  of SFAS  106  and SFAS  112,  or an
after-tax expense of $13 million ($0.10 per share).

RETURN ON EQUITY AND INVESTMENT

    Return on equity was  18.4 percent in  1993, 13.8 percent  in 1992 and  19.2
percent  in 1991. Return on investment was 14.6 percent in 1993, 11.8 percent in
1992 and  15.4  percent  in  1991.  The  adoption  of  SFAS  106  and  SFAS  112
significantly reduced ROE and ROI in 1992.

CURRENCY

    The  U.S. dollar strengthened an average of  9 percent in 1993 compared with
1992 in  relation  to  the  principal  foreign  currencies  in  countries  where
Honeywell  products  are  sold.  A  stronger dollar  has  a  negative  effect on
international results  because  foreign-exchange-denominated  profits  translate
into  fewer U.S. dollars of  profit; a weaker dollar  has a positive translation
effect.

INFLATION

    Highly competitive  market  conditions  and a  relatively  stagnant  economy
minimized  inflation's impact on the selling  prices of Honeywell's products and
the  cost   of   its   purchased  materials.   Productivity   improvements   and
cost-reduction  programs largely offset the effects  of inflation on other costs
and expenses.

EMPLOYMENT

    Honeywell employed 52,300 people worldwide  at year-end 1993, compared  with
55,400  people in 1992 and 58,200 people in 1991. Approximately 33,200 employees
work in the United States, with  19,100 employed outside the country,  primarily
in  Europe. Total  compensation and  benefits in 1993  were $2.7  billion, or 49
percent of total costs and expenses.  Sales per employee were $110,900 in  1993,
compared with $109,600 in 1992 and $106,100 in 1991.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

    Honeywell is committed to protecting the environment, a commitment evidenced
by   both  Honeywell's   products  and   Honeywell's  manufacturing  operations.
Honeywell's manufacturing sites generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes,
the treatment,  storage, transportation  and disposal  of which  are subject  to
various   local,  state  and  national  laws   relating  to  protection  of  the
environment. Honeywell is in varying  stages of investigation or remediation  of
potential,  alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or previously owned
or operated sites  and at  off-site locations where  its wastes  were taken  for
treatment  or  disposal.  In connection  with  the cleanup  of  various off-site
locations, Honeywell, along  with a  large number  of other  entities, has  been
designated  a  potentially responsible  party  (PRP) by  the  U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation
and  Liability Act  or by state  agencies under similar  state laws (Superfund),
which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for the costs  of
such   cleanup.  In   addition,  Honeywell   is  incurring   costs  relating  to
environmental remediation  pursuant to  the  federal Resource  Conservation  and
Recovery  Act. Based on Honeywell's assessment  of the costs associated with its
environmental responsibilities, compliance  with federal, state  and local  laws
regulating  the  discharge  of  materials  into  the  environment,  or otherwise
relating to the protection of the environment,  has not had, and in the  opinion
of Honeywell management, will not have a material

                                       13

effect  on  Honeywell's  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  capital
expenditures  or  competitive  position.  Honeywell's  opinion  with  regard  to
Superfund  matters is  based on its  assessment of  the predicted investigation,
remediation and associated  costs, its  expected share  of those  costs and  the
availability  of legal defenses.  Honeywell's policy is  to record environmental
liabilities when loss amounts are probable and reasonably estimable.

                       DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS BY SEGMENT

HOME AND BUILDING CONTROL

    Sales in Home  and Building Control  were $2.424 billion  in 1993,  compared
with  $2.394 billion in 1992  and $2.249 billion in 1991.  Sales in 1993 were up
slightly as stronger U.S. sales were mostly offset by a stronger U.S. dollar and
economic weakness  in  international  markets,  driven  in  large  part  by  the
continuing  recession in Europe. Home Control  gained market share in the United
States through  new product  introductions and  greater penetration  of the  OEM
market.  TotalHome-R-  was introduced  outside the  United  States in  1993. The
acquisition of Enviracaire in December 1992 also contributed to the  improvement
in  U.S.  sales.  Building  Control  experienced  strong  U.S.  interest  in its
comprehensive retrofit and service solutions for schools and other institutions.
The U.S. economy continues to show signs of improvement in these markets,  while
international   market  conditions  have   continued  to  deteriorate.  Economic
conditions may continue  to impede  new construction markets  in 1994;  however,
Home  and Building Control's  large worldwide installed  product base and market
strategies should  continue  to  support  continued  sales  growth,  given  that
retrofit and service revenues account for the largest portion of business.

    The  sales increase  in 1992 reflected  worldwide improvement  for both Home
Control and Building  Control despite weak  commercial construction markets  and
erratic  housing markets. Home Control  experienced increased market penetration
with original equipment  manufacturers and retailers,  and achieved growth  with
new product introductions. Building Control made market share gains in small-and
medium-sized  commercial  buildings,  and  there was  solid  growth  in vertical
markets such as schools and health-care facilities in the United States.

    Home and  Building  Control  operating  profit was  $233  million  in  1993,
compared  with $193  million in  1992 and  $229 million  in 1991.  Excluding the
impact of special charges, operating  profit increased slightly in 1993  despite
the   deepening  European   recession,  a  stronger   U.S.  dollar,  unfavorable
intra-European  currency   fluctuations,   additional  costs   associated   with
streamlining  the U.S. field organization, and costs associated with introducing
the new  EXCEL  5000TM  building  automation  platform  in  the  United  States.
Operating  profit included special charges of  $10 million for implementation of
programs to improve productivity and competitiveness.

    Operating profit in 1992 included special  charges of $43 million for  costs
associated  with worldwide facilities  consolidation, organizational changes and
work-force reductions incurred to  capitalize on emerging market  opportunities.
Excluding  these added  costs, operating  profit increased  over 1991,  paced by
strong performance in Home Control in the United States.

    Orders improved modestly in 1993 as stronger orders in the United States for
both Home  Control and  Building  Control offset  international weakness  and  a
stronger U.S. dollar. The backlog of orders showed a slight increase for 1993.

INDUSTRIAL CONTROL

    Industrial  Control sales were $1.692 billion  in 1993, compared with $1.744
billion in 1992 and $1.627 billion in 1991. Sales declined slightly in 1993  due
to  negative currency  translation trends  and the  divestiture of  the Keyboard
Division, which was sold to Key Tronic Corporation in the third quarter of 1993.
Excluding these  items,  both  Industrial Automation  and  Control  and  Control
Components  grew at moderate rates despite  weak market conditions in the United
States, Europe and  Latin America.  Industrial Automation  and Control  reported
solid  penetration gains  in targeted worldwide  markets despite  a weak capital
spending  environment   in   the   United  States   and   Europe.   Demand   for

                                       14

industrial systems increased in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Sales of field
instruments  showed  a strong  increase due  to  broad acceptance  of Industrial
Automation and Control's  smart field products.  Control Components  experienced
significant   growth  in  solid  state   sensors  for  on-board  automotive  and
information technology and appliance market segments as demand for durable goods
improved. The company expects a slight increase in 1994 Industrial Control sales
despite a slow economic environment worldwide.

    Industrial Control sales for 1992 increased moderately, despite the deferral
of industrial  automation systems  purchases in  the United  States due  to  the
inherent  uncertainty of  the economy  and worldwide  weakness in  durable goods
markets. There was modest growth in  Industrial Automation and Control sales  in
the  United States  as increased sales  of services and  measurement and control
products  offset  weakness  in  automation  systems.  Control  Component   sales
increased   moderately  in  1992,   benefiting  from  the   trend  by  equipment
manufacturers to  increase  sensor  utilization  for  quality  and  productivity
improvements.

    Industrial  Control operating profit was $190  million in 1993, $157 million
in 1992  and $224  million in  1991. Excluding  the impact  of special  charges,
operating  profit showed a slight increase in 1993. Profits were affected by the
weak capital spending environment in the  United States and Europe, strength  of
the  U.S.  dollar  and  aggressive investments  in  new  technologies,  with R&D
spending up 26 percent over 1992.  Operating profit included special charges  of
$9   million  for  implementation  of   programs  to  improve  productivity  and
competitiveness.

    Operating profit in 1992 included special  charges of $39 million for  costs
associated  with worldwide facilities  consolidation, organizational changes and
work-force reductions  to capitalize  on emerging  market opportunities.  Before
special  charges, operating profit was down in  1992 as a result of lower profit
margins reflecting a changing product mix in Industrial Automation and Control.

    In 1993,  Industrial  Control  orders declined  slightly,  due  to  negative
currency  translation trends.  Excluding this effect,  Industrial Automation and
Control orders increased modestly as a result of solid showings in Asia  Pacific
and  Latin  America.  Control Components  orders  declined slightly  due  to the
divestiture of the Keyboard Division. Micro  Switch orders were strong in  North
America and Asia Pacific. The backlog of orders was down modestly for the year.

SPACE AND AVIATION CONTROL

    Sales  in Space and  Aviation Control were $1.675  billion in 1993, compared
with $1.933 billion in 1992 and $2.132 billion in 1991. Sales in 1993  continued
to  decline as  anticipated as  a result of  the continuing  cyclical decline in
commercial aircraft  production, weak  demand  in the  business jet  market  and
decreased spending in the military market. We expect these trends to continue in
1994.

    Anticipated  growth  in  1992  did  not  materialize,  and  1992  sales  for
commercial  flight  systems  declined  sharply  as  financial  pressures  caused
airlines  to  defer, and  in  some instances  cancel,  aircraft and  spare parts
purchases. As expected,  military markets  were weak  as a  result of  declining
defense spending and flat NASA funding.

    Space  and  Aviation  Control operating  profit  was $148  million  in 1993,
compared with $176 million  in 1992 and $226  million in 1991. Operating  profit
declined  in 1993 due to the sharp  volume decline in sales of commercial flight
systems and  significant  investments  in  next-generation  avionics.  Operating
profit  included special charges of $7 million for implementation of programs to
improve productivity  and  competitiveness.  Because of  continued  weak  market
conditions, revenue and operating profit are expected to decline again in 1994.

    Operating  profit in 1992 included special  charges of $35 million for costs
associated with facilities consolidation,  organizational changes and  severance
pay  incurred to appropriately size operations to current and anticipated market
conditions.  Excluding  these  special   charges,  operating  profit  was   down
moderately in 1992 as a sharp volume decline in the commercial aviation business
was  partially offset by an improved cost structure and a favorable sales mix in
military avionics.

                                       15

    Space and Aviation orders were down in 1993 as commercial flight systems and
military  avionics  showed  sharp  declines.  Space  systems  orders   increased
moderately. The backlog of orders declined sharply from 1992 levels.

OTHER

    Sales  from other operations were $172 million in 1993, $152 million in 1992
and $185  million  in 1991.  These  sales  included the  activities  of  various
business  units, such as the Solid State  Electronics Center and the Systems and
Research Center,  which  do not  correspond  with Honeywell's  primary  business
segments.  These operations incurred operating losses  of $2 million in 1993, $9
million in 1992 and $3 million in  1991. The 1993 loss included special  charges
of  $16 million for  organizational changes and  work-force reductions. The 1992
loss included  special charges  of $3  million that  were also  associated  with
organizational changes and work-force reductions.

                               FINANCIAL POSITION

FINANCIAL CONDITION

    At  year-end 1993, Honeywell's  capital structure comprised  $188 million of
short-term  debt,  $504  million  of  long-term  debt  and  $1.773  billion   of
stockholders'  equity. The  ratio of  debt to total  capital was  28 percent and
remained unchanged from year-end 1992. Honeywell's debt-to-total capital  policy
range  is 30 to 40 percent. Honeywell  managed its capital structure during 1993
at or below the low end of this range.

    Total debt decreased $9 million  during 1993 to $692 million.  Stockholders'
equity  decreased $17 million in  1993. Contributing to the  decrease was a $209
million increase  in  treasury  stock. Other  changes  in  stockholders'  equity
included  an  increase in  retained earnings  of $322  million from  net income,
offset by dividends of  $122 million; a $3  million decrease in the  accumulated
foreign currency translation; and a $13 million decrease from the recognition of
a pension liability adjustment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  87,  "Employers'  Accounting  for  Pensions,"  (see  Note  16  to Financial
Statements on page 33).

    Several events and trends that  affected Honeywell's financial position  are
discussed below.

CASH GENERATION

    In  1993,  $475 million  of cash  was  generated from  operating activities,
compared with $532 million in  1992 and $489 million  in 1991. Included in  1992
operating  cash flow was $194 million, net of expenses and taxes, from autofocus
settlements. In 1993,  cash generated  from investing  and financing  activities
included  $47 million of  proceeds from the  sale of assets,  $20 million from a
reduction of investment in  Sperry Aerospace Group and  $18 million of  proceeds
from  employee  stock plans.  These funds  were primarily  used to  support $232
million of capital expenditures,  $14 million of  acquisitions, $122 million  of
dividend payments, $241 million of share repurchases and $7 million of long-term
debt repayments. Cash balances decreased $100 million in 1993.

WORKING CAPITAL

    Cash  used for  increases in  the portion  of working  capital consisting of
trade and long-term receivables and inventories, offset by accounts payable  and
customer  advances, was $2 million in 1993. This portion of working capital as a
percentage of sales  was 28  percent, compared with  26 percent  in 1992.  Trade
receivables  sold at year-end 1993 were $38  million, an increase of $22 million
in 1993.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS

    Capital expenditures for  property, plant  and equipment in  1993 were  $232
million,  compared with $244 million in 1992  and $240 million in 1991. The 1993
depreciation charges were $235 million. Honeywell continues to invest at  levels
believed  to  be  adequate  to  maintain  its  technological  position  in areas
providing long-term  returns. During  1993, Honeywell  invested $14  million  in
complementary business acquisitions.

SHARE REPURCHASE PLANS

    In  November  1990, the  board  of directors  authorized  a 4  million share
repurchase program. This program  was completed in 1991.  In November 1991,  the
board of directors authorized a five-year program to purchase up to $600 million
of  Honeywell shares. Under terms of  this authorization, which expires December
31, 1996, the  program may be  altered depending on  economic conditions,  share
prices and cash-flow availability. Honeywell repurchased $3 million of shares in
1991, $189 million of shares in 1992 and $240 million of shares in 1993, and has
$168 million remaining under this authorization.

    At  year-end  1993, Honeywell  had 188  million  shares issued,  132 million
shares  outstanding  and  33,382  stockholders  of  record.  At  year-end  1992,
Honeywell  had 188  million shares  issued, 137  million shares  outstanding and
34,571 stockholders of record.

DIVIDENDS

    In November 1992, the board of  directors approved an 8 percent increase  in
the regular annual dividend to $0.89 per share, from $0.825 per share, effective
in the fourth quarter 1992. In November 1993, the board of directors approved an
additional  8 percent increase in the regular annual dividend to $0.96 per share
effective in  the fourth  quarter  1993. Honeywell  paid  $0.9075 per  share  in
dividends  in  1993,  compared  with  $0.84125 in  1992  and  $0.76875  in 1991.
Honeywell has paid a quarterly dividend since 1932 and has increased the  annual
payout per share in each of the last 18 years.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PROGRAM

    Honeywell  contributed 643,913 shares of Honeywell common stock to employees
under its U.S. employee stock match savings plans in 1993. The number of  shares
contributed  under this program  depends on employee  savings levels and company
performance.

PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS

    Cash  contributions  to  Honeywell's  Retirement  Plan  for  U.S.  non-union
employees  were $105  million in 1993,  $79 million  in 1992 and  $61 million in
1991. Cash contributions to the Pension  Plan for U.S. union employees were  $36
million in 1993, $27 million in 1992 and $27 million in 1991.

TAXES

    In  1993,  taxes paid  were $92  million. Accrued  income taxes  and related
interest decreased $18 million during 1993.

FUNDING SPECIAL CHARGES

    During 1993  and 1992,  the company  established reserves  for  productivity
initiatives  to strengthen the company's competitiveness. Future cash flows from
operating activities are expected to be sufficient to fund these accrued costs.

LIQUIDITY

    Short-term debt  at  year-end 1993  was  $188 million,  consisting  of  $181
million  of  commercial  paper  and  $7 million  of  notes  payable  and current
maturities of  long-term debt.  Short-term debt  at year-end  1992 totaled  $188
million, consisting of $182 million of notes payable and commercial paper and $6
million of current maturities of long-term debt.

    Through  its  banks,  Honeywell  has access  to  various  credit facilities,
including committed credit lines  for which Honeywell  pays commitment fees  and
uncommitted  lines  provided by  banks on  a non-committed,  best-efforts basis.
Available lines of credit at year-end 1993 totaled $2.272 billion. This consists
of $1.875  billion  of committed  credit  lines to  meet  Honeywell's  financing
requirements, including support of commercial paper and bank note borrowings and
an  appeal bond which could be required in the Litton litigation as described in
Litigation below,  and $397  million of  uncommitted credit  lines available  to
certain  foreign subsidiaries.  This compared  with $1.002  billion of available
credit lines at year-end  1992, consisting of $645  million of committed  credit
lines and $357 million of

                                       17

uncommitted  credit lines  available to  certain foreign  subsidiaries. Cash and
short-term investments totaled $256 million at year-end 1993 and $346 million at
year-end 1992. Honeywell believes its available cash and committed credit  lines
provide adequate liquidity.

LITIGATION

    On  August 31,  1993, a  federal court  jury in  U.S. District  Court in Los
Angeles  returned  a  verdict  against  Honeywell  on  patent  infringement  and
intentional interference claims in the amount of $1.2 billion. These claims were
part  of a lawsuit brought by Litton  Systems Inc. alleging, among other things,
Honeywell patent infringement relating to the process used by Honeywell to  coat
mirrors  incorporated  in  its  ring laser  gyroscopes.  Honeywell  believes the
verdict is unsupported by the facts; that the Litton patent is invalid; and that
Honeywell's process differs from Litton's. The judge in the case held a  hearing
November 22, 1993, on various issues including, among others, Honeywell's claims
that  the patent was improperly obtained due to alleged "inequitable conduct" on
the part of Litton and Honeywell's other legal and equitable defenses. The court
has yet to enter a judgment. The trial will conclude when the court has resolved
legal issues that  could alter  or eliminate  the jury  verdict. Honeywell  will
evaluate  the outcome of the trial, including appealing any significant judgment
against the company.  No trial date  has been  set for the  antitrust claims  of
Litton and Honeywell.

    The  court has yet  to rule on significant,  complex and interrelated issues
that could alter  or eliminate the  jury verdict; therefore,  Honeywell and  its
counsel  have  determined that  it is  not  possible to  estimate the  amount of
damages, if any, that may ultimately be incurred. As a result, no provision  has
been made in the financial statements with respect to this contingent liability.
Honeywell  continues to believe the lawsuit  is without merit, and its financial
position, liquidity and business strategies have not been adversely affected  by
the jury verdict.

CREDIT RATINGS

    Honeywell's  credit  ratings  remained unchanged  during  1993.  Ratings for
long-term and short-term debt  are, respectively, A/A-1  by Standard and  Poor's
Corporation,  A/Duff1  by  Duff and  Phelps  Corporation and  A3/P-2  by Moody's
Investor Service, Inc. On August 31, 1993, Moody's Investor Service, Inc. placed
Honeywell on credit watch status as a  result of the jury verdict in the  Litton
litigation.  Any lowering  of Honeywell's present  credit ratings  could lead to
higher interest costs by potentially reducing Honeywell's ability to access  the
commercial  paper  market  and other  unsecured  borrowing sources  on  terms as
favorable as those currently available.

STOCK PERFORMANCE

    The market price of Honeywell stock ranged from $39 3/8 to $31 in 1993,  and
was $34 1/4 at year end. Book value at year end was $13.48 in 1993 and $13.10 in
1992.
