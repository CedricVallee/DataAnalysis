ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
OVERVIEW
 
We are principally engaged in the
production of copper replacement products which include refined copper products, copper wire produced from refined scrap copper
and CCA wire.
 
We manufacture and sell four major
types of refined copper products and copper alternative products: copper anode, pure copper rod, pure copper wire and CCA wire.  Copper
anode, pure copper rod and pure copper wire products are produced from refined scrap copper utilizing our proprietary scrap copper
recycling and cleaning technology and process.
 
In the first quarter of 2009, with
the completion of a 25,000 ton per annum capacity smelter, we introduced a new production process and product line which enables
us to produce pure copper products from scrap copper.  The new production process involves the fire refining of bulk
recycled copper into high purity, low oxygen content copper rods (also known as fire-refined high-conductivity rods).  We
then either sell these large diameter (8mm) copper rods into a range of markets, or further process these rods into much smaller
diameter (e.g., 0.03 mm) copper wire (also known as “superfine” copper wire). We believe this recycled superfine copper
wire is generally a more cost effective product for our customers, compared with pure copper wire manufactured from newly mined
copper.   We launched production of copper anode in July 2010, in conjunction with the completion of our second
scrap copper smelter, with an initial annual capacity of 25,000 tons. The completion of this second smelter doubled our recycled
copper refining and manufacturing capacity to 50,000 tons per year. In October 2011, we completed an efficiency upgrade of the
smelters and increased the copper anode smelting capacity to 35,000 tons per annum, and the copper rod smelting capacity to 50,000
tons per annum. The latest upgrade brought our total smelting capacity to 85,000 tons per annum. Copper anode is the fundamental
building block for almost all pure copper products, and holds a wide range of potential end market uses.  We believe
that our pricing advantage on our refined copper products can be maintained regardless of fluctuations in the commodity price of
copper.
 
We believe we were among the first
manufacturers to commercialize CCA superfine wire production in China. Currently we have three different CCA products: CCA fine
wire, CCA magnet wire and CCA tin plated wire. CCA fine wire is the raw material for CCA magnet wire and CCA tin plated wire.  In
the case of CCA magnet wire, we coat the CCA fine wire with a special magnetic coating, while in the case of CCA tin plated wire,
we plate the CCA fine wire with a very thin layer of tin.  The value added nature of our CCA superfine wire products
lies in our ability and technology to draw down from much larger diameter CCA raw wire, and further process it to produce super
fine CCA magnet wire and CCA tin plated wire. As a result, CCA magnet wire and CCA tin plated wire command higher market prices
and higher gross margins than plain CCA fine wire.  We draw pure copper wire from the refined pure copper rod we produce.  The
pure copper wire we produce has three main sub categories of products: fine wire, magnet wire and tin plated wire. These three
copper wire products have the similar characteristics as the three CCA wire products mentioned above.
 
We have expanded our business from
the CCA superfine wire segment into the scrap copper refinery business because we believe that the scrap copper refinery business
allows us to sell into the much bigger pure copper products market and offers us the ability to grow more rapidly while utilizing
the proprietary equipment and technology that we possess relating to both the scrap copper cleaning as well as superfine wire drawing.  
We believe that the ability to sell into the large and growing copper and copper replacement products market in China offers us
substantial opportunity to increase our sales in the future.   We anticipate that we will continue to expand production
capacity in both refined copper products and CCA wire, but that the majority of our investment and resulting planned growth in
sales volume will occur in the refined copper products business, which caters to a much bigger pure copper products market, compared
with the CCA wire market.
 
We sell our products primarily in
China, either through distributors or directly to users, including distributors in the wire and cable industries and copper conglomerates
as well as manufacturers in the consumer electronics, white goods, automotive, utility, telecommunications and specialty cable
industries.

Our market for copper anode is
very large and diverse as copper anode is the raw material for copper cathode, which in turn is the foundation for most pure
copper products.  For our other three main product categories (copper rod, copper wire and CCA wire), our markets
overlap to a degree, and are characterized by their breadth and depth, with a very large number of current and potential
customers for each product category. Copper rod is a raw material used in wire and cable production.  Our refined
copper products (copper anode, copper rod and copper wire), which are manufactured from recycled scrap copper, compete
directly with copper products made from “virgin” (e.g. newly mined) copper.  To date, our raw material
costs for bulk scrap copper have been lower than prices for “virgin” copper, which provides us with a pricing
advantage in the market for the refined copper products we produce from scrap copper.  During 2011, we sold copper
anode to a few copper conglomerates, which use our product to produce copper cathode.  We sold copper rod to a few
customers, most of which are producers of smaller diameter copper wire used in power cables ranging in size from high voltage
power transmission cables to white good applications such as internal wiring in household appliances and consumer
electronics.  Our copper wire, which is sold in a variety of diameters and may have undergone further in-line
processing such as coating with plastic, is sold to many of the same types of end-use customers who purchase copper wire from
our copper rod customers.  These include manufacturers of a wide range of power cables and products that
incorporate wiring, such as household appliances, automobiles, consumer electronics and telecommunications
equipment.  Our CCA wire is sold to many of these manufacturers also.  CCA wire sells at a lower cost per
unit of weight than pure copper wire, due to the relatively lower density of the aluminum core which makes up most of the
volume of CCA wire.  Our CCA wire offers conductivity performance characteristics that are only marginally below
those of pure copper wire, which means they are attractive in a wide variety of product applications where a slight reduction
in conductivity standards is tolerable (such as most of the household appliance, automotive, consumer electronics and
telecommunications applications).  Examples of relatively high tolerance product applications where our CCA wire
would not provide an acceptable replacement option for pure copper wire would be military/space equipment and wiring in
nuclear power plants.  One low tolerance product category that requires pure copper wire rather than our less
costly CCA wire is electric motors, which require pure copper wire windings.  The markets for each of our product
lines are growing rapidly, due both to growing demand in China for copper products including all types of basic wire raw
materials and the relative cost advantages our product lines carry over “virgin” pure copper competitor
products.
 
We believe that we are well positioned
to continue to capture further market share in the copper and replacement product industry. Our refined copper products produced
from recycled copper and CCA wire are increasingly being accepted as cheaper alternatives to pure copper products. As a result,
our sales and net income have increased substantially during the last three years. We generated sales of $161.5 million, $370.5
million and $637.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 and 2011, respectively. We achieved net income of $13.7
million, $38.5 million and $53.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.  In 2010
and 2009, we had non-cash charges of $1.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively, which resulted from the extinguishment and the
change in the fair value of the warrants issued to investors in conjunction with our issuance of convertible preferred stock in
October 2008. Excluding the impact of these non-cash charges, net income for 2010 and 2009 were $39.7 million and $25.6 million,
respectively, up 55.1% and 118.8%, respectively, from the prior year.  In 2011, we had a non-cash gain of $3.2 million,
which resulted from extinguishment and the change in the fair value of the warrants. Excluding the impact of these non-cash gains,
net income for 2011 was $50.0 million, up 25.8% from the prior year.
 
Our capacity to sell our copper anode,
copper rod, recycled copper wire products (drawn from copper rod) and CCA wire products (drawn from larger diameter CCA wire) is
limited by the number and capacity of the equipment we have installed to produce these products.  Our copper anode and
copper rod are made from bulk scrap copper, which is cleaned, purified and smelted in large capacity smelter units.  At
the present time we have two smelting facilities allocated to copper rod and copper anode production. The copper anode smelter
is capable of producing 35,000 tons per year and the copper rod smelter is capable of producing 50,000 tons per annum.  In
2011, we sold 31,943 tons of copper anode and 30,283 tons of copper rod and wire.  As of December 31, 2011, we operated
approximately 80 high speed wire drawing machines, which draw larger diameter copper rod or CCA rod into much finer diameter wires,
with a total capacity of approximately 7,500 tons per annum of CCA wire and approximately 20,000 – 25,000 tons per annum
of 0.03mm – 1.60mm diameter range copper wire. The above referenced copper wire production capacity does not include the
production of the thickest class of copper wire we produce, that with a diameter range of 1.65mm – 1.75mm. In 2011, we sold
6,336 tons of CCA wire. Certain of these drawing machines incorporate additional production steps such as coating, annealing or
magnetizing the fine wire produced.  These drawing machines are manufactured to our design and specifications by custom
equipment manufacturers located in China.  We are not dependent on any single custom equipment manufacturer for the fabrication
of our drawing lines.  In the first half of 2010, we added six high-capacity copper wire drawing production lines, all
of which are used to draw copper wire from our copper rod, and increased our annual capacity to 20,000 – 25,000 tons of copper
wire.  In the third quarter of 2010, we added a new smelter with 25,000 tons of annual capacity and started copper anode production.  In
October 2011 we increased the production efficiency and capacity of each smelter and increased the total smelting capacity to 85,000
tons. As a result, the copper rod production capacity is more than that for superfine copper wire and we are expecting to see some
copper rod sales in the sales mix going forward, should we produce more copper rod than the copper wire drawing capacity can absorb
as raw material. On the new plant construction site, we are adding two new smelters with 25,000 - 30,000 tons of annual capacity
each, which are anticipated to be completed by the end of April 2012.  Accordingly, we do not anticipate that our sales
will be capacity-constrained in the near future, even if we continue to experience rapid sales growth.

Historically, we have taken a conservative
approach in estimating the annual capacity of each main product category. Specifically, in the wire product categories (CCA and
copper wire), our historical total annual capacity estimate was based upon the capacity assumption on drawing the thinnest superfine
wire, even though we often produced and sold larger millimeters of wire. Since drawing the thinnest diameter of superfine wire
(i.e. 0.03 mm) takes the longest time, the estimated annual capacity that we have disclosed assumes only the smallest possible
wire production capacity that we could attain.
 
We produce and sell a wide variety
of superfine CCA and copper wire products according to customer order specifications. In 2011, the average CCA and copper wire
diameters we produced and sold was in the range of 0.03 mm to 2.6 mm, which were thicker than the thinnest wire diameter we can
produce. As a result, the actual sales volume of these two products exceeded our estimated production capacity, since such estimate
is based upon the thinnest wire diameter production. We are capable of producing annual production capacities for CCA and copper
wire in the range of 6,000 – 8,000 tons and 20,000 – 25,000 tons ((in the thickness range of 0.03mm – 1.60mm),
respectively. This capacity estimate does not include the drawing capabilities of the thickest copper wire in the range of 1.65mm
– 1.75mm.
 
Given the production capacity estimates
are conservative based upon the assumptions that are used, as described above, management does not expect the current CCA and copper
wire capacity to limit potential sales. However, such analysis and determination will be performed by us regularly in future years
and any changes will be timely disclosed. Currently we do not have plans to expand the production capacity for the existing CCA
and copper wire products. We are in the process of completing construction and addition of two new smelters with 25,000 –
30,000 tons of capacity each, which are anticipated to be completed by the end of April 2012. We have completed the research and
development of new products in the CCA cable and wire category, and are in the process of obtaining manufacturing permits while
planning to add capacity for the new products. Currently we are planning to launch this new product in the next 12 to 18 months.
The timing of this launch is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to: receipt of production license, our capital
investment plan, as well as working capital needs.
 
Significant Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
 
The most significant factors that affect our financial
condition and results of operations are:
 
·        
product mix and implications on gross margins;
·        
supply and costs of principal raw materials;
·        
copper prices and supply and demand of copper;
·        
production capacity; and
·        
economic conditions in China;
 
Product mix and effect on gross margins
 
Our gross margin is affected by our product mix. We produce
and sell products according to customer orders.  In our wire products (pure copper wire and CCA wire), magnet wire and
tin plated wire are final products from which we will derive the highest production markup, or gross profit.  We also
generate a significant portion of revenue from selling semi-finished products such as fine wire at a lower production cost markup,
or gross profit.
 
Generally, copper anode and copper rod products
contribute a lower gross profit margin compared to the wire products.  However, given the quick turnover and large
volume production of the refined copper products, as well as primarily cash on delivery payment terms with our customers, the
return on invested capital for the refined copper products and working capital turnover are much better than that of the wire
products.
 
Supply and costs of principal raw materials
 
Our ability to manage our operating costs depends significantly
on our ability to secure affordable and reliable supplies of raw materials. We have been able to secure a sufficient supply of
raw materials, which consist primarily of scrap copper and CCA raw material wire.
 
 Field: Page; Sequence: 43; Value: 1 
 Field: Sequence; Type: Arabic; Name: PageNo 41 Field: /Sequence 
 
 Field: /Page 
 
The price of our primary raw materials varies with reference
to copper prices, and changes in copper price affect our cost of sales.  However, we are able to price our copper and
CCA products based on our material procurement costs plus a fixed dollar mark-up, which is essentially our gross profit.  Therefore,
despite the implications of copper price movement on our gross and net profit margin figures, during the past three years the mark-up,
or our gross and net profit in absolute dollars, have not been materially affected by the change in copper prices.
 
Copper prices and supply and demand of copper
 
Generally the price of our products is set at a certain
discount to local retail copper prices, and we believe our products replace or supplement copper. For these reasons, our products
are affected by the market price, demand and supply of copper.
 
We price our refined copper and CCA wire products based
on the market price for materials plus a fixed dollar mark-up, which is essentially our gross profit. As copper prices rise, our
fixed dollar mark-up per ton processed represents a relatively lower percentage of our gross sales (which is generally based on
tons processed) and therefore our gross profit margin as a percentage of sales is relatively lower; as copper prices decline, the
inverse is true and we report relatively higher gross profit margins on a percentage basis.  Despite the implications
of copper price volatility on our gross and net profit margins in percentage terms, during the past three years the markup, or
our gross and net profit in absolute dollar terms, has not been materially affected by the change of copper prices. Shanghai Changjiang
Commodity Market, one of the major metal trading markets in the PRC, publishes the copper trading prices twice daily. These prices
typically set the range for the prices of our materials as well as finished products, and are generally followed by all industry
participants.
 
Production capacity
 
In order to capture the market opportunity for our products,
we have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our production capacity. Increased capacity has had, and could continue to have,
a significant effect on our results of operations, by allowing us to produce and sell more products to generate higher revenues
and net income.
 
Economic conditions in the PRC
 
We operate our manufacturing facilities in the PRC and
derive the majority of our revenues from sales to customers in the PRC. As such, economic conditions in the PRC will affect virtually
all aspects of our operations, including the demand for our products, the availability and prices of our raw materials and our
other expenses. The PRC has experienced significant economic growth, achieving a CAGR of 14.8% in gross domestic product from 1999
through 2011 according to National Bureau of Statistics of China. Domestic demand for and consumption of copper and CCA products
have increased substantially as a result of this growth. We believe that economic conditions in the PRC will continue to affect
our business and results of operations.
 
PRINCIPAL INCOME STATEMENT COMPONENTS
 
Sales
 
Our sales are derived from sales of our products net
of value-added taxes.
 
The most significant factors that affect our sales are
shipment volume and average selling prices.
 
Our collection practices generally consist of cash payment
on delivery. However, we also extend credit for 30 days to 60 days to certain of our established customers in the CCA wire category.
 
Cost of sales
 
Our cost of sales primarily consists of direct material
costs, and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead costs. Direct material costs generally accounted
for the majority of our cost of sales.

 Field: /Page 
 
Gross Profit
 
Our gross profit is affected primarily by the cost of
raw materials, which is defined with reference to the cost of copper.  We are also able to price our products based on
the market price for materials plus a fixed dollar mark-up, which is essentially our gross profit.
 
Operating expenses
 
Our operating expenses consist of selling, general and
administrative expenses, and research and development expenses.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 
Our selling expenses include shipping expenses, salaries
and traveling expenses for our sales personnel.  Our general and administrative expenses include administrative staff
costs and other benefits, depreciation of office equipment, professional service fees and other miscellaneous expenses related
to our administrative corporate activities.
 
Our sales activities are conducted through direct selling
by our internal sales staff.  Because of the strong demand for our products, we have not had to start to aggressively
market and distribute our products, and our selling expenses have been relatively small as a percentage of our revenues.
 
We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative
expenses will increase with the anticipated growth of our business and continued upgrades to our information technology infrastructure.
We expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will also increase as a result of compliance, investor-relations
and other expenses associated with being a publicly listed company.
 
Other income and expense
 
Other income and expense includes interest income, interest
expense, merger costs, foreign currency translation adjustments, and other income.
 
Our interest expense consists of expenses related to
our short term bank borrowings.  We expense all interest as it is incurred.
 
Change in fair value of warrants
 
The fair value of the Company’s issued and outstanding
Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, and the Warrants issued to placement agents in conjunction with the Company’s initial
public offering in September 2009, decreased to $615,000 as of December 31, 2011 and the Company recognized a $3,065,575 gain,
which is a non-cash gain from the change in fair value of these warrants for the year ended December 31, 2011. In future periods,
we may experience significant gains or losses, as the value of these warrants fluctuates in response to changes in our stock price.
As of December 31, 2011, all of the Series A Warrants have been exercised and none remained outstanding.
 
Income taxes
 
Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands and British
Virgin Islands, we are not subject to any income or capital gains tax, and dividend payments we make are not subject to any withholding
tax in the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands. Under the current laws of Hong Kong, we are not subject to any income or capital
gains tax and dividend payments we make are not subject to any withholding tax in Hong Kong.
 
The PRC New Tax Law imposes a 10% withholding income
tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside the PRC for distribution
of earnings generated after January 1, 2008. Under the New Tax Law, the distribution of earnings generated prior to January 1,
2008 is exempt from the withholding tax. As our subsidiaries in the PRC will not be distributing their earnings to the Company
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011 to the Company, no deferred tax liability has been recognized for the undistributed
earnings of these PRC subsidiaries through December 31, 2011. Total undistributed earnings of these PRC subsidiaries at December
31, 2011 was RMB937,148,032 ($148,732,408).

Our two operating subsidiaries are governed by the PRC
income tax laws and are subject to the PRC enterprise income tax (“EIT”).  Each of the two entities files
its own separate tax return.  According to the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC, foreign invested enterprises
established prior to January 1, 2008 were entitled to full exemption from income tax for two years beginning from the first year
when enterprises become profitable and have accumulative profits and a 50% income tax reduction for the subsequent three years.  Being
converted into a Sino-foreign joint equity enterprise in 2005, Lihua Electron was thus entitled to the EIT exemption in 2005 and
2006, and has been subject to the 50% income tax reduction for the period from 2007 to 2009.  Set out in the following
table are the EIT rates for our two PRC Operating Companies from 2006 to 2011:

Sales
 
Our business for the year ended December 31, 2011 continued
to demonstrate robust growth.  Net sales increased by 71.9% from $370.5 million in 2010 to $637.1 million in 2011. This
growth was primarily driven by: (i) strong market demand for our CCA and copper wire products; (ii) the launch of the new smelting
capacity in the third quarter of 2010, which operated a full year in 2011 and allowed us to keep up with increased product demand;
(iii) the further increase in the smelting capacity in October 2011, and (iv) the increase of copper prices during 2011 relative
to 2010. Please see the table below for more details regarding the product sales breakdown by specific category.

The overall sales volume increase of 53% in 2011 over
2010 is the result of additional production volume in our existing products in 2011 as a result of the capacity addition incurred
throughout 2010 in both our wire products and copper anode product, and smelting capacity expansion in October 2011, partially
offset by the reduction in copper rod sales as a result of increased use of rod internally as raw material for copper wire. Sales
volume of CCA and copper wire in 2011 has grown 22% from fiscal year 2010 as a result of wiring drawing capacity expansion in the
first half of 2010. We added six new copper wire drawing production lines in the first half of 2010 and thus expanded copper wire
production capacity from 18,000 tons (expanded in October 2009) per annum to 20,000 – 25,000 tons per annum, for production
of the wires in the thickness range of 0.03mm – 1.60mm. We began production and sales of copper anode in August 2010, and
sold 31,943 tons and 12,330 tons of copper anode in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Since we expanded our copper wire production capacity
in the first half of 2010, beginning in the third quarter of 2010, we nearly fully utilized all copper rod produced for internal
copper wire production, thereafter greatly reduced the sales volume of copper rod to outside customers. With the copper rod production
capacity increase in October 2011, to the extend our copper rod production capacity exceeds copper wire production capacity, we
anticipate that we will sell copper rod to the market in future periods.
 
We sell our products based on the prevailing market price
at the time of the sale. Factors impacting average selling prices of our products are copper price fluctuation, and in the case
of the wire products, the average diameter of the wire products we sold during the period - the thicker the wire diameter the lower
the sale price, and vice versa.

Average gross profit margin
decreased to 11.9% in 2011 as compared to 16.8% in 2010, primarily as a result of the addition of copper anode, which is a lower
margin product compared to the wire products. In addition, as a result of the copper wire capacity addition, copper wire products
sales have increased significantly as a percentage of total sales in 2011, when compared with fiscal year 2010.  Since
copper wire is a lower gross margin product than CCA wire, the increase in copper wire sales also contributed to the decrease in
average CCA and copper wire gross margin as well as overall gross margin.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses were
$9,136,120 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $7,805,501 for the same period last year, an increase of 17.0%.
 
Selling expenses were $2,485,978 for the year ended December
31, 2011, an increase of 20.8% compared to the same period last year. The increase was attributable to:
 

·Increased costs related to product distribution and insurance as a
result of expanded business volume; and

·Increased staffing costs as we continued to expand the sales force
during the period.
 
Included in selling expenses were shipping and handling
costs of $2,051,193 and $1,630,898 in 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing an increase of 26%, while tons of products sold
by us increased 53% compared to 2010. Excluding the sale of copper anode, which was launched in the second half of 2010, tons of
CCA and copper wire and rod products sold increased 13% in 2011. Copper anode sales have only been made to three customers, all
of whom are located in nearby cities and/or provinces that are within close proximity to our production location. Due to their
proximity to our facilities, the costs of shipping and handling for copper anode sales were significantly less than the costs of
sales for our other products to customers that are located further from our facility. , Depending on customer’s requests
on a case-by-case basis, shipping and handling costs for our products may either be borne by us or by our customers. The greater
percentage increase in shipping and handling costs compared to the percentage increase in tons of products of wire and rod products
sold during 2011 was attributable to more customers requesting us to bear these costs compared to last year.
 
General & administrative expenses were $6,650,142
for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of 15.7% compared to the same period last year. The main factors which caused
this increase were (i) higher administrative and professional fees associated with the Company being a public reporting company
and our expanded scale of operations; and (ii) higher research and development costs as we have completed R&D for new CCA products
and developed R&D partnerships with Shanghai Electric Cable Research Institute and Beijing Modern Recycling Economy Research
Institute in 2011.
 
Interest Expense
 
Interest expense was $143,779 for the year ended December
31, 2011, compared to $131,106 for the same period last year. The increase was mainly due to the increase in interest rates.
 
Income Tax
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, income tax expense
was $17,323,700, reflecting an effective tax rate of 24.6%.  The effective tax rate for the same period in 2010was 27.4%.
Excluding the non-taxable fair value change on warrants and the operating loss of the US entity, the effective tax rate was 24.9%
and 25.4% for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Commencing in 2010, both Lihua Electron and Lihua Copper
have been subject to an EIT rate of 25%.
  
Net Income
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $53.1
million, or 8.3% of net revenue, compared to $38.5 million, or 10.4% of net revenue, in the same period in 2010. The net income
for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was impacted by a $3.1 million non-cash gain and $1.3 million non-cash charge, respectively,
as a result of the change of the fair value of the warrants. Excluding the impact of these non-cash items, net income for the year
ended December 31, 2011 was $50.0 million, up 25.8% from the prior year.
 
Foreign Currency Translation Gains
 
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the RMB rose
against the US dollar, and we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $9.2 million.

The overall sales volume increase of 79% in 2010 over
2009 is the result of capacity addition in our existing products, as well as production and sale of new product in 2010, partially
offset by the reduction in copper rod sales as a result of increased use of rod internally as raw material for copper wire. Sales
volume of CCA and copper wire in 2010 has grown 85% from fiscal year 2009 as a result of capacity expansion in the first half of
2010. We added six new copper wire drawing production lines in the first half of 2010 and thus expanded copper wire production
capacity from 18,000 tons (expanded in October 2009) per annum to 20,000 – 25,000 tons per annum. We began production and
sales of copper anode in August 2010, and sold 12,330 tons of copper anode in 2010. Since we have expanded the copper wire production
capacity in the first half of 2010, beginning in the third quarter of 2010, we were able to fully utilize copper rod for internal
copper wire production, and subsequently no longer sold copper rod to outside customers for the remainder of 2010.
 
We sell our products based on the prevailing market price
at the time of the sale. Factors impacting average selling prices of our products are fluctuations in copper prices, and in the
case of the wire products, the average diameter of the wire products we sold during the period - the thicker the wire diameter
the lower the sale price, and vice versa.

Average gross profit margin has decreased to 16.8% in
2010 as compared to 22.4% in 2009, primarily as a result of the addition of copper anode, which is a lower margin product compared
to the wire products. In addition, as a result of the copper wire capacity addition, the copper wire product sales have increased
significantly as a percentage of total sales in 2010, when compared with fiscal year 2009.  Since copper wire is a lower
gross margin product than CCA wire, the increase in copper wire sales also contributed to the decrease in average CCA and copper
wire gross margin as well as overall gross margin.

Total selling, general and administrative expenses were
$7,805,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $5,714,000 for the prior year, an increase of 36.6%.
 
Selling expenses were $2,058,000 for the year ended December
31, 2010, an increase of 19.5% compared to the prior year. The increase was attributable to:
 

·Increased costs related to product distribution and insurance as a
result of expanded business volume; and

·Increased staffing costs as we continued to expand the sales force
during the period.
 
Included in selling expenses were shipping and handling
costs of $1,630,898 and $1,303,346 in 2010 and 2009 respectively, representing an increase of 25%, while tons of products sold
by us increased 79% compared to 2009. Excluding the sale of copper anode which was launched in the second half of 2010, tons of
CCA and copper wire and rod products sold increased 30% in 2010. Copper anode sales have only been made to three customers, all
of whom are located in nearby cities and/or provinces that are within close proximity to our production location. Due to their
proximity to our facilities, the costs of shipping and handling for copper anode sales were significantly less than the costs of
sales for our other products to customers that are located father from our facility. Depending on customer’s requests on
a case-by-case basis, shipping and handling costs for our products may either be borne by us or by our customers. The lesser percentage
increase in shipping and handling costs compared to the percentage increase in tons of products of wire and rod products sold during
2010 was attributable to fewer customers requesting us to bear these costs compared to 2009.
 
General & administrative expenses were $5,747,000
for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 44.0% compared to the prior year. Factors which caused this increase
were higher administrative and professional fees associated with the Company being a public reporting company and our expanded
scale of operations.

Interest Expense
 
Interest expense
was $131,106 for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $335,335 for the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to
the repayment of short term bank loans which were used for working capital purposes.
 
Income tax
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, income tax expense
was $14,499,576, reflecting an effective tax rate of 27.4%.  The effective tax rate for the same period in 2009 was 27.6%.
Excluding the non-taxable fair value change on warrants and the operating loss of the US entity, the effective tax rate was 25.4%
and 16.0% for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
In 2009, Lihua Electron was subject to an EIT rate of
12.5%, and Lihua Copper was subject to an EIT rate of 25%.  Starting 2010, both entities’ EIT rate was 25%.
 
Net Income
 
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $38.5 million,
or 10.4% of net revenue, compared to $13.7 million, or 8.5% of net revenue, in the same period in 2009. The net income for
the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was impacted by a non-cash charge of $1.3 million and $11.9 million, respectively, as
a result of the change of the fair value of the warrants. Excluding the impact of these non-cash charges, net income for the year
ended December 31, 2010 was $39.7 million, up 55.1% from the prior year.
 
Foreign Currency Translation Gains
 
During the year
ended December 31, 2010, the RMB rose against the US dollar, and we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of $4.6 million.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
We have historically financed our operations and capital
expenditures through cash flows from operations, bank loans and fund raising through issuing new shares in the capital markets.
 
The Company has not transferred cash between our operating
subsidiaries and the offshore parent company. As of December 31, 2011, total cash held in Renminbi and U.S. dollars was RMB665.6
million (or $105.6 million based on the conversion rate of US$1 = RMB6.3009 on the same date). We maintain cash in U.S. dollars
in an offshore account in Hong Kong, to pay for U.S. related expenses such as legal fees and external investor relation firm fees
for being a public company in the U.S.
 
As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately
$105.6 million in cash, up $15 million from $90.6 million at December 31, 2010. Starting November 2010, the Company commenced
construction of a 180 mu (approximately 30 acre) new plant. Two new copper anode smelters with 25,000 – 30,000 tons of
annual capacity each will be added on this new plant, which is anticipated to be completed by the end of April 2012. In
addition, the Company plans to add new production facilities for its new CCA cable and wire product on the new plant
site. The estimated additional capital spending for the remaining infrastructure  for the smelting facilities,
planned capacity addition of the new CCA cable and wire products, as well as the completion of the construction of the entire
new plant site, is $35 – 40 million. As a result of expanded production capacity following the completion of the new
plant, the Company is expecting higher sales, higher depreciation and other operating costs, and an overall increase in net
income in the year 2012 and beyond.

Operating activities
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by
operating activities totaled $33.4 million compared to $29.7 million and $8.4 million in the same period of 2010 and 2009, respectively.
This was primarily attributable to: i) $53.1 million in net earnings; ii) a $3.5 million accounts receivable decrease, which was
mainly caused by the shorter credit terms we granted to our wire customers as our raw material cost increased and a tightening
credit market in China; iii) a $1.4 million inventory decrease, resulting from more efficient use of raw materials and finished
goods; offset by iv) a $21.3 million prepayments for raw material purchases, which was primarily caused by advanced payment for
the importation of our raw material from overseas; and (v) a $1.8 million increase in other receivables, deposits and prepayments,
which was primarily caused by prepaid R&D costs paid to research institutes.
 
Investing activities
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing
activities totaled $20.3 million compared to $12.0 million and $5.1 million in the same period of 2010 and 2009, respectively.
This was primarily attributable to a total net cash outflow of $20.3 million for the purchase of and deposits paid for property,
plant and equipment and construction in progress, primarily as a result of capital investment in new equipment and machinery
and building of new workshops, all being part of our planned expansion.
 
Financing activities
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in financing
activities totaled $2.6 million compared to cash inflow of $35.9 million and $5.2 million in the same period of 2010 and 2009,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we spent $2.1 million for stock repurchase and $2.3 million for repayment of
short term bank loans and we received proceeds of $1.9 million from the exercise of warrants of the PIPE investors.
 
In January 2011, the Board of Directors authorized management
to repurchase stock over a 12-months period with a total value of up to $15 million (the “Repurchase Program”). The
Company has purchased 264,047 shares in the open market at aggregate cost of $2.1 million. The initial repurchases were funded
with US dollars the Company had in its Hong Kong bank account, and the subsequent repurchases were funded by an aggregate of $1.3
million loans, denominated in U.S. dollars, from Magnify Wealth Enterprise Limited (“Magnify Wealth”), a British Virgin
Islands corporation and an entity affiliated with Mr. Jianhua Zhu, our CEO and Chairman. The Company repaid Magnify Wealth in
full, in RMB. While the Company’s operating subsidiaries in the PRC have substantial cash reserves available, the laws of
the PRC restrict the conversion of RMB to U.S. dollars, such that the Company has encountered difficulty funding the Repurchase
Program with U.S. dollars from cash held by its PRC subsidiaries. The Company explored possible alternative arrangements for funding
the Repurchase Program in U.S. dollars with financial institutions, but Company management determined that such alternatives would
have been costly or otherwise not appropriate for the Company. The Repurchase Program expired in January 2012.
 
Capital expenditures
 
Our capital expenditures are principally directed for
expansion of production facilities, including construction and purchases of property, plant and equipment. In 2009, 2010 and 2011,
we funded our capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operating activities and the proceeds of bank borrowings,
and equity issuance.
 
In 2012, as we accelerate our expansion, we expect continued
capital expenditures for maintaining existing machines and adding manufacturing equipment in our 180 mu new plant site, which is
adjacent to our existing plant. We currently have two smelting facilities which can produce a total of 85,000 tons of refined copper
products per year.  We plan to complete the addition of smelting facilities on the new plant site by the end of April
2012 and increase our refined copper capacity to 135,000 – 145,000 tons per year. With our current capacity of production
lines, we can produce 7,500 tons of CCA wire and 20,000 - 25,000 tons of copper wire with the diameter range of 0.03mm –
1.60mm.  We have completed the research and development of a new CCA cable and wire product and are in the process of
completing production license application and capacity addition for the new product on our new plant site. At the present time
we estimate that this new product will be launched in 12 to 18 months. Construction of the entire 180 mu (approximately 30 acres)
new plant site construction is anticipated to be completed in year 2013. The estimated additional capital spending for the remaining
infrastructure spending for the smelting facilities, planned capacity addition of the new CCA cable and wire products, as well
as the completion of the construction of the entire new plant site, is $35 – 40 million. For the future planned capacity
expansion, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility
will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs to bring all of our facilities into full production. We
may, however, require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any
investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue.

Accounts receivable
 
In 2011, we sold 34,743 tons of CCA and copper wire,
31,943 tons of copper anode and 1,876 tons of copper rod.  In 2010, we sold 28,388 tons of CCA and copper wire, 12,330
tons of copper anode and 3,994 tons of copper rod. As CCA is an emerging product in the PRC, Lihua extends credit terms to some
of its larger customers. However, pure copper products, such as our copper anode, copper rod and copper wire, are in such high
demand that we don’t have to extend credit terms. Our customers often purchase more than one type of product from us (for
example, one customer may purchase both CCA wire and copper wire).  CCA wire purchases are generally accorded 30 to 60
day payment terms, depending upon the creditworthiness of the customer, while the copper wire (and copper rod and anode) purchases
are payable upon delivery to the customer, which may occur two to seven days after we ship the product and recognize our revenue.
This decision to extend terms or to collect payment upon receipt (essentially a “cash sale”, although due to the shipping
time this effectively becomes a very short receivable), is based primarily upon the product type. We may extend terms for CCA purchases
to a credit-worthy customer, but for that same customer require payment upon delivery for purchases of copper anode, rod and/or
copper wire.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK
 
Foreign Exchange Risk
 
Substantially all of our revenues
and expenditures are denominated in Renminbi. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollars and Renminbi
will affect our financial results in U.S. dollars terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results
of operations. The Renminbi’s exchange rate with the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things,
changes in the PRC’s political and economic conditions. The exchange rate for conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies
is heavily influenced by intervention in the foreign exchange market by the People’s Bank of China. From 1995 until July
2005, the People’s Bank of China intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately
8.3 Renminbi per U.S. dollar. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of
the Renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. However, the Renminbi is restricted to a rise or fall of no more than 0.5% per day versus
the U.S. dollar, and the People’s Bank of China continues to intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant
short-term fluctuations in the Renminbi exchange rate. Nevertheless, under China’s current exchange rate regime, the Renminbi
may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. There remains significant
international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in
a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.

Any devaluation of the Renminbi against
the U.S. dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms
of U.S. dollars. On the other hand, the appreciation of the Renminbi could make our customers’ products more expensive to
purchase because many of our customers are involved in the export of goods, which may have an adverse impact on their sales. A
decrease in sales by our customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, we had cash denominated in Renminbi amounting to RMB665.4 million ($105.6 million) and RMB595.2 million ($89.9 million),
respectively.
 
We recognized a foreign currency
translation adjustment of approximately RMB59.1 million ($9.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2011.
 
Very limited hedging transactions
are available in the PRC to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions
in an effort to reduce its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in
the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully
hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that
restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency.
 
Interest Rate Risk
 
We are exposed to interest rate risk
arising from short-term variable rate borrowings from time to time. Our future interest expense will fluctuate in line with any
change in our borrowing rates. We believe our exposure to interest rate risk and other relevant market risks is not material. We
did not have short term bank borrowing outstanding as of December 31, 2011. However, we may incur short-term bank borrowings under
our working capital revolving line of credit from time to time.
 
Inflation
 
In recent years, the PRC has not
experienced significant inflation, and thus inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations. According to
the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the change in Consumer Price Index in China was -0.7%, 3.3% and 5.4% in 2009,
2010 and 2011 respectively.
