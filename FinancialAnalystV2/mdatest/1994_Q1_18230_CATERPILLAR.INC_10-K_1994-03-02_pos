1987 STK OPTION PLAN

                               CATERPILLAR INC.
                      1987 STOCK OPTION PLAN, AS AMENDED
                             AS OF APRIL 14, 1993


1. ESTABLISHMENT OF PLAN

     Caterpillar Inc. (hereafter referred to as the "Company") proposes to grant
to selected key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries restricted stock
awards, options to purchase common stock of the Company and stock appreciation
rights in conjunction therewith for the purposes of (i) furnishing to such
employees maximum incentive through ownership of Company shares to improve
operations and increase profits and (ii) encouraging such persons to accept or
continue employment with the Company and its subsidiaries. Such restricted stock
awards, options and stock appreciation rights will be granted pursuant to the
plan herein set forth, which shall be known as the Caterpillar Inc. 1987 Stock
Option Plan (hereafter referred to as the "Plan"). 

     The Company also proposes to grant to the members of the Company's Board of
Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company at the time of a
grant (hereinafter referred to as "Outside Directors") options to purchase
common stock of the Company pursuant to the Plan. The purpose of such option
grants is to provide incentives for highly qualified individuals to stand for
election to the Board and to continue service on the Board and to encourage
increased stock ownership by Outside Directors in order to promote long-term
stockholder value. Stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, and
incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422A of the Internal Revenue
Code, will not be granted to Outside Directors under the Plan.

2. STOCK RESERVED FOR OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

     Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3, the maximum number of
shares of the Company that may be issued upon the granting of restricted stock
awards, performance awards or the exercise of options and Stock Appreciation
Rights under the Plan or any Supplement hereto shall not exceed 7,500,000. The
shares so issued may be authorized but unissued shares, Treasury shares, or
previously issued shares purchased for purposes of the Plan. Any shares subject
to options or awards may thereafter be subject to new stock options or awards
under the Plan if there is a forfeiture of any such awards or lapse, expiration
or termination of any such option but not if there is a surrender of an option
or portion thereof pursuant to a stock appreciation right as provided hereafter
in Section 7. 

3. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS

     If there is any change in the outstanding shares of common stock without
any consideration to the Company by stock dividend, stock split-up, change in
par or no par value, or other similar event, the number and kind of shares then
remaining available for issue under the Plan shall be correspondingly changed,
and a similar adjustment shall be made in the unexercised portion of all options
then outstanding without change in the aggregate purchase price to be paid. 

     Options and stock appreciation rights may also contain provisions for the
continuation thereof, and for other equitable adjustments, after other changes
in the Company's shares, including changes resulting from recapitalization,
reorganization, sale, merger, consolidation, or other similar occurrence. 

4. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN

     The authority to grant restricted stock awards, options and stock
appreciation rights to officers and employees under the Plan shall be vested in
the Stock Option and Officers' Compensation Committee (hereafter referred to as
the "Committee") consisting of not less than three members of the Board of
Directors appointed from time to time by the Board. No member of the Board shall
serve on the Committee at a time when such member is, or within one year prior
thereto has been, eligible to receive restricted stock awards, options, or stock
appreciation rights under the Plan, or restricted stock awards, options, or
stock appreciation rights under any other stock option or stock bonus plan of
the Company; provided, however, that Outside Directors who receive options under
this Plan may serve on the Committee. The Committee shall have no authority
regarding the granting of options to Outside Directors.


     Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee from time to time
shall determine (except as to options granted to Outside Directors) the
individuals to whom, and the time or times at which, restricted stock awards,
options, or stock appreciation rights shall be granted; the number of shares to
be subject to each restricted stock award, each option, and each stock
appreciation right; the option price per share; the extent to which stock
appreciation rights are exercisable for cash, or stock, or a combination of cash
and stock; whether restricted shares [shares of common stock issued under
restrictions which subject them to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" (as
defined in Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) until
the restrictions lapse] should be issued on the exercise of an option or stock
appreciation right and, if so, the nature of the restrictions; the duration of
each option; the specific restrictions applicable to restricted stock awards and
the other terms and provisions of each restricted stock award, option, and stock
appreciation right. In the case of officers to whom restricted stock awards,
options, or stock appreciation rights may be granted, the selection of such
officers and all of the foregoing determinations shall be made directly by the
Committee in its sole discretion. In the case of key employees other than
officers, the selection of such employees and all of the foregoing
determinations may be delegated by the Committee to an administrative group of
officers chosen by the Committee. Neither restricted stock awards, options, nor
stock appreciation rights granted to one employee need be identical to those
granted other employees. 

     Commencing with the 1988 annual meeting of stockholders, options with a
term of ten years and one day shall be granted to each Outside Director for
1,000 shares of the Company's common stock effective as of the close of each
annual meeting of the stockholders (i) at which such individual is elected a
director or (ii) following which such individual will continue to serve as a
director as a member of a continuing class of directors. Any option so granted
shall be a nonqualified stock option. In the event any change in the outstanding
shares of the Company's common stock occurs and an adjustment is made in the
unexercised portion of options outstanding, as provided in Section 3 above, a
similar adjustment shall be made in the number of shares to be granted to
Outside Directors thereafter under this paragraph. 

     Subject to the provisions of the Plan specifically governing options
granted or to be granted to Outside Directors, the Committee may also interpret
the Plan; prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the
Plan; and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plan. The determinations of the Committee shall be made in
accordance with its judgment as to the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and in accordance with the purposes of the Plan. The Committee's
determinations shall in all cases be conclusive. 

     A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and
all determinations of the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members.
Any determination of the Committee may be made, without notice or meeting, by
the written consent of a majority of the Committee members. 

5. ELIGIBILITY

     Restricted stock awards, options, and stock appreciation rights may be
granted to officers and other key employees of the Company or of its present or
future subsidiaries. Options will be granted to Outside Directors as provided in
Section 4 hereof.

     A director of the Company or a subsidiary who is not also an employee of
the Company or a subsidiary shall not be eligible to receive a restricted stock
award, stock appreciation right, or an alternative stock option. An employee or
officer who has been granted a restricted stock award, option, or stock
appreciation right under this or any other stock option plan may or may not be
granted additional restricted stock awards, options, and stock appreciation
rights at the direction of the Committee. 


OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

6. OPTION PRICE
     The per share option price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the time the option is granted. The per share
option price of options granted to Outside Directors shall be 100% of the market
value of the common stock at the time an option is granted.


7. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

     Stock appreciation rights will permit the holder to elect to surrender any
option or any portion thereof which is then exercisable and receive in exchange
therefor shares of common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. Such stock,
cash, or combination shall have an aggregate value equal to the excess of the
fair market value of one share of common stock over the purchase price specified
in such option multiplied by the number of shares of common stock covered by
such option or portion thereof which is so surrendered. The fair market value of
one share of common stock shall equal (a) in the case of such a holder who is
not a Company officer, the mean of the highest and lowest quoted selling price
of shares of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date of surrender and (b) in the case of such a holder who is a Company officer,
but subject to the provisions of the succeeding sentence, the highest of the
means of the highest and lowest quoted selling price of shares of the Company's
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange determined for each day occurring
during the window period during which such election to surrender the option or
portion thereof is made; and the window period is the applicable period for
making such an election (currently ten business days) prescribed from time to
time pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. In the case of such a holder who is a Company officer, the fair market
value of one share of common stock with respect to the surrender of an incentive
stock option granted, shall equal the mean of the highest and lowest quoted
selling price of shares of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the date of surrender unless it is specifically provided in the
option form, or any amendment thereto, that the valuation described in item (b)
above shall apply. In the case of any option holder who at the time of an
election is an officer of the Company, each election to receive cash alone or in
combination with stock shall be subject to the approval of the Committee in its
sole discretion. 

     Stock appreciation rights may be granted as part of a stock option or as a
separate right to any holder of any option theretofore or then being granted
under this Plan. A stock appreciation right shall be exercisable upon any
additional terms and conditions (including, without limitation, the issuance of
restricted shares and the imposition of restrictions upon the timing of
exercise) which may be determined as provided in Section 4 of the Plan. 

     In the event of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the number of
shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of
shares of common stock covered by such option or portion thereof which is
surrendered in connection with such exercise. No fractional shares shall be
issued on the exercise of a stock appreciation right. 

8. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

     Options (other than options granted to Outside Directors) shall be
exercisable in such installments and during such periods as may be fixed by the
Committee at the time of granting. Options granted to Outside Directors shall
become exercisable as follows: one-third at the end of each of the three
successive one-year periods commencing on the date of each option grant.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no option and no stock appreciation
right shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten years and one day from
the date such option or stock appreciation right is granted, provided that no
incentive stock option (or related stock appreciation right) shall be
exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date such option is
granted. 

     Payment of the purchase price shall be made upon exercise of all or a
portion of any option. Such payment shall be made pursuant to rules adopted by
the Committee and the Company in cash or by the tendering (through one
transaction or in a series of consecutive transactions) of shares of common
stock of the Company having a fair market value equal to 100% of such purchase
price or by any combination thereof. The fair market value of a share of common
stock so tendered shall be the mean of the highest and lowest quoted selling
price of shares of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on
date of exercise. In addition, on the exercise of an option, surrender of a
stock appreciation right, or upon the granting of any restricted stock award or
performance award, any applicable taxes which the Company is required to
withhold shall be paid to the Company and any information which the Company
deems necessary shall be provided to the Company. In fulfilling its withholding
obligation, the Company may withhold a portion of any shares to be issued to
satisfy such withholding obligation in accordance with rules promulgated by the
Committee, in its sole discretion. 


9. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

     Each option granted to an officer or employee shall, and each stock
appreciation right granted to an officer or employee may, in the Committee's
sole discretion require a period or periods of continued employment with the
Company and/or its subsidiaries before it may be exercised in whole or in part.
No such period shall be less than one year except that the Committee may permit
a shorter period in the event of termination of employment by reason of
retirement or death. 

     Termination of the employment with the Company and its subsidiaries of an
officer or employee who holds an option shall terminate any remaining rights
under options and stock appreciation rights then held by such holder except as
hereinafter provided. 

     Each option and stock appreciation right granted to an officer or employee
may provide that if employment of the holder with the Company and its
subsidiaries terminates after completion of a period of employment so specified,
the option or stock appreciation right may be exercised (to the extent then
exercisable) by the holder (or, in the event of the holder's death, by whoever
shall have received the holder's rights under the option or stock appreciation
right) during a specified period of time after such termination of employment.
Such a specified period of time may not exceed sixty months where termination of
employment is caused by retirement or death and sixty days where it results from
any other cause; provided that if death occurs after termination of employment
but during the period of time so specified, such period may be extended to not
more than sixty-six months after retirement, or thirty-eight months after
termination of employment for any other cause. In the event that any such option
or stock appreciation right granted under the Plan has a specified period for
exercise after retirement or death which is less than the maximum period
permitted under this section, the Committee may modify such option or right to
extend such specified period up to such maximum period. 

     Such options and stock appreciation rights shall not be affected by
authorized leaves of absence or by any change of employment so long as the
holder continues to be an employee of the Company or a subsidiary.  Nothing in
the Plan or in any such option or stock appreciation right shall interfere with
or limit in any way the right of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries to
terminate any employee's employment at any time, nor confer upon any employee
any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may change the post-termination
period of exercisability of an option or stock appreciation right provided that
no such change shall extend the original maximum term of the option or stock
appreciation right. 

9A. TERMINATION OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORSHIP

     No period of continued service as an Outside Director following the grant
of an option shall be required to render exercisable an option granted to an
Outside Director in the event an Outside Director holding an option which has
not become exercisable or has not been fully exercised shall cease to be an
Outside Director. In such event any such option may be exercised at any time
within sixty months of the date such Director ceased to be a Director. In the
event an Outside Director shall die holding an option which has not become
exercisable or has not been fully exercised, his executors, administrators,
heirs or distributees, as the case may be, may exercise such option at any time
within sixty months of the date of such death provided that if death occurs
after the date an Outside Director ceases to be a Director, such option shall be
exercisable within sixty-six months of such date. In no event, however, shall an
option which has expired by its terms be exercisable.

10. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

     Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, there may be
granted under the Plan, other than to Outside Directors, incentive stock options
as defined in Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code as it may be amended
from time to time. The Committee from time to time shall determine whether any
incentive stock options shall be granted. It shall also determine in its full
discretion the individuals to whom, and the time or times at which, any such
grants shall be made. Incentive stock options shall not by their terms be
transferable by the holder other than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution and shall be exercisable during the holder's lifetime only by the
holder. The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is
granted) of the stock with respect to which incentive stock options are
exercisable for the first time by the holder during any calendar year (under all


incentive stock option plans of the Company) shall not exceed $100,000;
provided, however, that all or any portion of an option which cannot be
exercised as an incentive stock option because of such limitation may be
converted by the Committee to an option other than an incentive stock option.
The Board of Directors of the Company may amend the Plan from time to time as
may be necessary (1) to comply with Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code,
or other sections of the Code or other applicable laws or regulations, and (2)
to permit any options granted as, or converted to, incentive stock options to
have all of the features provided for incentive stock options in the applicable
laws and regulations. 

11. TRANSFERABILITY OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

     Options and stock appreciation rights shall not be transferable otherwise
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercisable,
during the holder's lifetime, only by the holder except in the case of holder's
incapacity or disability when such options and stock appreciation rights may be
exercised by the holder's duly appointed guardian or representative.  

     A holder, however, may file with the Company a written designation of a
beneficiary or beneficiaries (subject to such limitations as to the classes and
number of beneficiaries and contingent beneficiaries and such other limitations
as the Committee from time to time may prescribe) to exercise, in the event of
the death of the optionee, an option or stock appreciation right, subject to the
provisions of the Plan. A holder may from time to time revoke or change any such
designation of beneficiary and any designation of beneficiary under the Plan
shall be controlling over any other disposition, testamentary or otherwise;
provided, however, that if the Committee shall be in doubt as to the right of
any such beneficiary to exercise any option or stock appreciation right, the
Committee may determine to recognize only an exercise by the legal
representative of the optionee, in which case the Company, the Committee and the
members thereof shall not be under any further liability to anyone. 

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

12. GRANTING OF AWARDS

     The Committee from time to time may determine whether any restricted stock
awards shall be granted to other than an Outside Director either alone or in
combination with the granting of options under the Plan. The Committee will in

               subsidiaries except for termination due to retirement after a
               specified age, disability,  death or other special circumstances
               approved by the Committee. 

     Shares awarded as a restricted stock award will be issued subject to a

without charge to the grantee.

SUPPMTL PENSION PLAN




                                                                  Exhibit 10 (c)

                       SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION BENEFIT PLAN
                (AS AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF JANUARY 1, 1994)

SECTION 1.  INTRODUCTION

      1.1  Background.  Caterpillar Inc. has amended the Retirement Income Plan
to limit the monthly amount payable to employees, retired employees and former
employees who are receiving pension benefits under that plan so that benefits
payable under that plan cannot exceed the maximum pension benefit limitations
imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").  This Supplemental Pension Benefit Plan (the "Plan"), as
set forth in the succeeding Sections of this document, provides additional
pension benefits to persons hereinafter described who are eligible for benefits
under this Plan and supplements monthly amounts of retirement income payable
under such Retirement Income Plan.

      1.2  Use of Terms.  Certain terms, as used in this Plan, are defined in
Section 8 or elsewhere in this Plan, and are capitalized, and when so used shall
have the defined meanings given to them in this Plan.

SECTION 2.  ELIGIBILITY

      2.1  Eligibility for and Accrual of Benefits.  The Plan, as set forth
below, applies only to persons who from time to time are receiving, are eligible
to receive or are accruing retirement income on or after the Effective Date
under the Retirement Income Plan.  An employee shall accrue benefits under this
Plan in accordance with the provisions of subsections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof so long
as he remains covered under the Retirement Income Plan and 1) his compensation
exceeds the limitation imposed by Code Section 401(a)(17), as adjusted for
cost-of-living pursuant to that Section or 2) his benefits under that plan are
limited by Code Section 415, as adjusted for cost-of-living pursuant to that
Section.

SECTION 3.  PAYMENT OF BENEFITS

      3.1  Benefit Formula.  A monthly supplemental pension benefit will be
payable under this Plan to an Eligible Person in each month equal to the excess
of (a) the amount of retirement income that would be payable to such person for
that month under the Retirement Income Plan but for the limitations contained in
subsections 4.6 and 4.8 of the Retirement Income Plan, as amended, over (b) the
amount actually paid to such person for that month under the Retirement Income
Plan.

      3.2  Future Adjustments.  Supplemental pension benefit amounts payable
under this Plan may be adjusted to take into account future amendments to the
Retirement Income Plan, increases in retirement income that are granted under
the Retirement Income Plan due to cost-of-living increases or other factors and
adjustments made by the Secretary of the Treasury (in regulations or otherwise)
to the limitations under Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 such that the total
amount payable to an Eligible Person under this Plan and the Retirement Income
Plan shall equal the monthly amount of retirement income that would be payable
under the Retirement Income Plan in the absence of subsections 4.6 and 4.8 of
the Retirement Income Plan.

      3.3  Commencement of Benefits.  Benefits shall commence under this Plan on
the first day of the month on or after the Effective Date that benefits become
payable to an Eligible Person in accordance with subsection 3.1 hereof and shall
continue thereafter so long as benefits are payable in accordance with
subsections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof.

SECTION 4.  OPTIONAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS

     If, in lieu of monthly normal retirement income payable under the
Retirement Income Plan, an Eligible Person receives optional retirement benefits
under that plan, then optional pension benefits (to the extent not otherwise
payable under the Retirement Income Plan because of the limitations contained in
subsections 4.6 and 4.8 thereof) will also be payable in the same form under
this Plan; except that the joint and survivor annuity described in subsection
6.3 of the Retirement Income Plan, as amended, shall be applicable solely to
benefits payable under that plan and shall not be available under this Plan.


SECTION 5.  FINANCIAL PROVISIONS

      No funding of benefits shall be required, and any benefits payable under
this Plan shall be payable by the Company.

SECTION 6.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

     While the Company expects and intends to continue the Plan, it must
necessarily reserve the right to modify, amend or terminate the Plan in whole or
in part, at any time.  Accordingly, the Company reserves the right to amend,
modify, suspend or terminate the plan, in whole or in part, at any time by
action of its Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Vice-President of
Human Services Division, acting together with the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of
the Board, may amend this Plan if such amendment does not involve an annual cost
to the employers under this Plan of more than $500,000 per year and if such
amendment does not change the duties and responsibilities of the committees and
persons designated to administer this Plan.

SECTION 7.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO THE PLAN

      7.1  Vested Rights.  Any Eligible Person who is fully vested in his
retirement income benefits under the Retirement Income Plan shall be fully
vested in his right to receive his accrued additional pension benefits under
this Plan upon his retirement under the Retirement Income Plan; and any such
pension benefits so vested and accrued shall be non-forfeitable.

      7.2  Benefits Not Assignable.  Except insofar as may be contrary to
federal law or to the laws of any state and jurisdiction in the premises and
except as further provided hereunder, benefits under the Plan are not in any way
subject to the debts or other obligations of the persons entitled to such
benefits, and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily sold, transferred or
assigned; except that

          (a)  any person who is entitled to benefits under this Plan may assign
          his benefits hereunder to the Company for the sole purpose of repaying
          (in whole or in part) the amount of any overpayment made under this
          Plan;

          (b)  any person entitled to benefits under this Plan also may assign
          any portion of such benefits otherwise due hereunder to any lawful
          taxing authority for the purpose of payment of any taxes which are due
          or may become due on account of such benefits; and

          (c)  any person entitled to benefits under this Plan may assign such
          benefits to a bank for the purpose of depositing them in his or her
          account in such bank, provided such assignment is pursuant to and in
          accordance with a current applicable bank agreement between such
          person and the bank and is filed with the Company.

      Any assignment made in accordance with the foregoing, except one made
pursuant to paragraph (a) above, shall be revocable at any time by the person
who shall have authorized it, and any payment pursuant to any such assignment
will constitute a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for payment
of such amount.

      7.3  Plan Administered by Company.  The Plan will be administered by the
Company, and the Company reserves the power to adopt such rules of procedure and
regulations, which shall be applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner,
as it deems necessary to administer the Plan and to determine all questions
arising under the Plan; provided, however, that the Company, by resolution of
its Board of Directors, may designate any person, committee, board or similar
body to act as named fiduciary or fiduciaries under the Plan and allocate any
and all of its duties and responsibilities under the Plan to such named
fiduciary or fiduciaries.  If the Board of Directors allocates any of its duties
and responsibilities under the Plan to a named fiduciary, such named fiduciary
shall be substituted for the Company wherever such term appears under the Plan
with respect to any duties and responsibilities so allocated.  Such named
fiduciary or fiduciaries may designate other persons to carry out its fiduciary
responsibilities under the Plan.


      7.4  Facility of Payment.  If the Company shall receive evidence
satisfactory to it (1) that a payee entitled to receive any payment provided for
in the Plan is physically or mentally incompetent to receive such payment and to
give a valid release therefor, (2) that another person or an institution is then
maintaining or has custody of such payee, and (3) that no guardian, committee or
other representative of the estate of such payee shall have been duly appointed,
the Company, in its discretion, may make the payment to such other person or
institution and the release of such other person or institution shall be a valid
and complete discharge for the payment.  In the absence of the appointment of a
legal guardian, any minor's share may be paid to such adult or adults as have,
in the opinion of the Company, assumed the custody and principal support of such
minor.

      7.5  Company Action.  Any action (to the extent not allocated under
subsection 7.3) required or permitted to be taken by the Company under the Plan
(other than to amend or terminate the Plan) may be taken by the Chairman or
Vice-Chairman of the Board or any Vice-President of the Company or any other
person designated by any or each of them.  The Plan shall be amended or
terminated in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.

      7.6  Small Payments.  If the monthly amount of supplemental pension
benefits to which any person is entitled under the provisions of this Plan at
any time shall be less than twenty dollars ($20) per month but more than nine
dollars and ninety-nine cents ($9.99), pension payments may be made quarterly,
each such quarterly payment to be in an amount equal to the sum of the monthly
amounts that would otherwise have been payable during the same quarter, and to
be made on the first day of the third month of such quarter.  If the monthly
benefits to which any person would otherwise be entitled under the plan at any
time shall be less than ten dollars ($10) per month, there may be paid to such
person, in lieu of monthly pension payments, a cash payment in an amount which
is the actuarial equivalent (as determined by the Actuary) of such monthly
pension benefits.

                       MANAGEMENT AND SALARIED EMPLOYEES
                     (AMENDED AND RESTATED AS OF 10/15/93)


SECTION 1.  TYPE OF PLAN AND PURPOSE

1.1  Type of Plan and Purpose.  This Plan is an incentive compensation
     plan. The purpose of the Plan is to provide contingent benefits to
     Employees to reflect their efforts in contribution to the profitability of
     the Company; and to serve as an incentive for Employees further to
     contribute to the continued and future financial success of the Company and
     to its ability to provide continued employment opportunities to its
     Employees.

     This Plan has been adopted in accordance with rules and guidelines
     established by the Stock Option and Officers' Compensation Committee of the
     Board of Directors of the company.  Those guidelines permit business and
     service units of Caterpillar Inc. or its subsidiaries to adopt separate
     incentive compensation plans within parameters established by that
     Committee based upon measurements approved by the company's internal
     Incentive Compensation Review Committee.  Those guidelines (a) generally
     require that a portion of the award under any such unit plan be based upon
     the corporate return on assets measurement established under this Plan, and
     (b) permit such unit plan to adopt a shorter eligibility period.  Those
     unit incentive compensation plans with such a corporate measurement form a
     part of the Plan.

     It is understood that the duty of the Employers, their Boards of Directors,
     and the management they select is to provide the Employers' shareholders
     protection of, and a maximum return on, their investment, consistent with
     retention in the business of such profits as the Board of Directors of the
     Company deems prudent, and with fair and competitive prices, wages,
     benefits and other terms of employment; no provision of this Plan or any
     unit incentive compensation plan shall be construed as altering that
     objective or in any way limiting management of such Board of Directors in
     the performance of their duties.

1.2  Supplements.  The succeeding provisions of this Plan will be expanded
     and/or modified by Supplements.  Such Supplements will set forth the
     particulars wherein the provisions of this Plan, as applied to any group of
     Employees are expanded and/or differ from those set forth in the succeeding
     provisions of this Plan exclusive of such Supplements.  All provisions of
     this Plan are subject to any express provisions to the contrary contained
     in any such Supplements.

     earlier) multiplied by 12; or (ii) in the case of a Participant who is a
     salaried employee, his weekly salary rate as of December 31 of that year
     (or his last day on the salaried payroll during that year if earlier)

     this Plan, the Controller and Treasurer are not included in the definition
     of Officer.

2.8  Participant means any Employee who is eligible to be covered by the
     Plan  pursuant to Subsection 3.1.

2.9  The first Plan Year will begin on the effective date and will end on
     the first December 31 thereafter.  Each subsequent Plan Year will end on
     the next following December 31.

SECTION 3.  ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

3.1  Eligibility and Participation.  Each Employee of the Employers shall be 
     eligible to be covered by the Plan and become a Participant as of the
     latest to occur of (i) the Effective Date; (ii) the date he has completed
     one or more years of Company Service; and (iii) the date he is included in
     a group to which the Plan has been and continues to be extended by an
     Employer.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for
     all purposes of the Plan, any U.S. International Service Employee who is
     not an Employee of the Company or any of the other Employers shall be
     considered to be an eligible Employee if he then meets the requirements of
     Subparagraph (ii) above.  As used herein, the term "U.S. International
     Service Employee" means an Employee who (i) on the direction or with the
     permission of an Employer is transferred to employment outside of the
     United States of America with a subsidiary (whether or not organized or
     incorporated within the United States of America) which has not adopted the
     Plan; and (ii) meets the definition of a U.S. International Service
     Employee contained in the Company's U.S. International Service Practices;
     and the term Employee shall also include such other persons as shall be
     designated by the Committee.  A Participant in the Plan shall continue as
     such so long as he meets the definition of an Employee contained in
     Subsection 2.5 or considered to be an Employee pursuant to this Subsection
     3.1.


     Notwithstanding the above, payment amounts shall not be duplicated under
     this Plan by amounts paid for the same period of service or corporate
     performance measurement under any other profit sharing plan, incentive
     compensation plan, or similar plan sponsored by Caterpillar Inc. or any
     of its subsidiaries, or would be paid except for any applicable waiting
     period expressed in such plan. However, an Officer who is eligible to
     participate in an incentive compensation plan for a business or service
     unit under his control may participate in this Plan for that portion of
     his Annual Salary Rate not included in the calculation of his business
     or service unit incentive compensation payment.

3.2  Employment Requirements. Any Participant shall be eligible for an
     incentive compensation benefit under the Plan for any year, provided that
     he is actively employed by the Company and any of its subsidiaries on
     December 31 of that year or is on leave of absence or layoff from the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries on such December 31; except that any
     otherwise eligible Employee who died, retired, or received a separation
     payment in lieu of layoff during such year shall also be covered as if he
     were an active Employee on December 31 of that year.

SECTION 4.  AMOUNT OF BENEFIT

4.1  Salary Grade 23 and Below. The amount payable to a Participant at Salary
     Grade 23 and below shall be determined by multiplying the Participant's
     Annual Salary Rate times 7%, times the applicable Corporate Performance
     Factor.

4.2  Salary Grade 24 and Above. The amount payable to a Participant at Salary
     Grade 24 and above shall be determined by multiplying his Annual Salary
     Rate times the Team Award percentage (determined from Exhibit I for
     non-Officer Participants in Salary Grades 24 and above, and from Exhibit 2
     for Officers), for his salary grade as of December 31, times the applicable
     Corporate Performance Factor, plus the amount of his Individual Award. 
     Designated Officers may participate in their units' incentive compensation
     plan and may be eligible for Team Awards based on their division results
     and the corporate performance of Caterpillar Inc.

     Individual Awards may be made only from a discretionary pool. A separate
     Employee Discretionary Pool will be established for Participants (excluding
     Officers) for each Vice Presidential administrative area or for each group
     of Participants subject to a business or service unit incentive
     compensation plan. A separate discretionary pool will be established for
     Officers.
     
     The Individual Award, if any, for which only Participants in Salary Grades
     24 and above are eligible, shall be determined solely at the discretion of
     the Participant's Unit Manager (or by the Compensation Committee of the
     Board of Directors for Officers) and shall not exceed the amount of the
     Employee's Team Award. In addition, the sum of the Individual Awards
     payable to all Participants in Salary Grade 24 and above shall not exceed
     the Employee Discretionary Pool Amount. The Employee Discretionary Pool
     Amount shall be 25% of the total amount of the Team Awards paid to
     Participants at Salary Grade 24 and above (excluding Officers).

     The sum of the Individual Awards payable to Participants who are Officers
     shall not exceed the Officer Discretionary Pool Amount. The Officer
     Discretionary Pool Amount shall be the sum of each Officer's percentage of
     annual salary rate (See Exhibit 1) adjusted by the Corporate Performance
     Factor defined in Section 4.4. The Officer Discretionary Pool will be
     calculated as if all officers participated wholly and exclusively in the
     Corporate Incentive Compensation Plan.


4.3  Individual Performance Level Less Than Five. Notwithstanding the
     provisions of Subparagraphs 4.1 or 4.2 to the contrary, Employees with a
     performance rating of Individual Performance Level 5 will not be eligible
     for a Team Award or an Individual Award, and contributions shall not be 
     made to either the Participant Discretionary Pool Amount or the Officer
     Discretionary Pool Amount for such Employees or Officers. 

4.4  Corporate Performance Factor.  The Corporate Performance Factor will be
     determined each year in relation to minimum, target and maximum corporate
     return on asset (ROA) levels determined by the Company (see Exhibit 3). 
     The actual performance factor will be determined by interpolation based on
     the actual ROA achieved at the end of the year compared to these levels,
     and the participants team incentive compensation amount, if any, will be
     calculated accordingly.  The achieved ROA will be determined by dividing
     Profit by the Average Gross Assets rounded to the nearest third decimal. 
     The Company must achieve the minimum ROA percentage specified before any
     amount shall be payable.

     As used herein, the term "Average Gross Assets" means the total corporate
     assets averaged throughout the year.  Total corporate assets excludes the
     assets of Financial Products but includes the investment in Financial
     Products and is reported in the Annual Report and the Quarterly Report to
     Stockholders under the column entitled Machinery and Engines as
     Supplemental Consolidating Data on the Statement of Financial Position. 
     The average for the year will be calculated by adding together five
     points: the ending balance for the previous year and the ending balance
     for each of the four quarters during the year and dividing by five.  The
     term "Profit" means the amount of profit for the year before income taxes
     reported in such Statement 1 (or any equivalent successor statement thereto
     which provides such amount of profit) in the subtotal immediately preceding
     the provision for income taxes line, but increased by the amount of accrual
     for that year for incentive compensation amounts payable under the Plan and
     any other similar incentive compensation plan or profit sharing plan of the
     Employers (excluding any investment plan of the Employers) and any awards
     granted under any bonus plan of the Employers.  Such Profit before income
     taxes would exclude the effect of extraordinary gains or losses, if any, as
     defined by generally accepted accounting principles.  Profit shall also
     exclude income from nonconsolidated operations.  Consolidated Financial
     Statements which are prepared using generally accepted accounting
     principles and as audited by the Company's independent certified public
     accountants shall be final and conclusive.

4.5  Percentage Determination.  The Employee's Team Award percentage, Individual
     Award percentage, Employee Discretionary Pool Amount percentage, Officer
     Discretionary Pool Amount percentage, the Corporate Performance Factors,
     the Company's ROA target percentage, and the minimum and maximum percentage
     will be determined for each year by the Committee on Stock Options and
     Officer's Compensation.

4.6  RIP, EIP, etc. Credit.  100% of the amount paid under the Plan to an
     Employee shall be counted as compensation for the month in which payment is
     made for purposes of the Retirement Income Plan or any other pension plan
     sponsored by Caterpillar Inc. or its subsidiaries, in which the Employee is
     a Participant.  No incentive compensation amount shall be taken into
     account under the Employee's Investment Plan, the Group Insurance Plan, or
     any other employee benefit plan or payroll practice of Caterpillar Inc. or
     its subsidiaries.

4.7  Proration of Payment Amount.  If an Employee is not a Participant or is not
     actively employed by an Employer for the entire year but is eligible for an
     incentive compensation amount for the year pursuant to the provisions of
     Subsection 3.2, his payment amount will be prorated based 


     upon his days of active employment in that year on the management or
     salaried payrolls while a Participant.  Days while on disability leave of 
     absence will be counted as days of active employment in accordance with 
     uniform rules established by the Committee with respect to the maximum 
     number of such days to be counted during any period of disability leave
     of absence, but in no event shall any days occurring after the 
     expiration of a continuous period of absence of six months be counted.
     No other leaves of absence will be counted for purposes of calculating 
     the payment amount.

4.8  Participation in Another Incentive Compensation Plan.  If an Employee, who
     otherwise met the eligibility requirements of Section 3, ceased to be a
     Participant during the Plan Year because he became a participant in another
     incentive compensation plan sponsored by Caterpillar Inc. or one of its
     subsidiaries, he shall be eligible for a Team Award and/or an Individual
     Award under this Plan for that period of time that he was a Participant in
     this Plan.  Twenty five percent (25%) of the prorated Team Award paid under
     this Plan shall be included in the Employee Discretionary Pool Amount.

4.9  Transfer from Hourly Payroll.  To Notwithstanding anything contained herein
     to the contrary, if a Participant or former Participant is employed by the
     Employers on December 31 of any Plan Year and does not receive for any
     period of employment in that Plan Year a payment under either this Plan or
     the profit sharing plan covering employees on the hourly payroll of the
     Employers, he shall receive a payment under this Plan for such period of
     employment in the same amount which would otherwise have been payable to
     him under the terms of this Plan or under such hourly plan but for his
     ineligibility thereunder because he was not participating therein on said
     December 31.

4.10 Supplemental Employees.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
     contrary, if (a) a Participant ceases to be a full-time Employee of an
     Employer, and (b) on December 31 of the year in which said Participant
     ceases to be a full-time Employee, he is and has thereafter been
     continuously employed as a supplemental employee on either a part-time or
     temporary basis by an Employer, his payment amount shall be prorated based
     upon his days of active regular full-time employment in that year on the
     salaried or management payroll while a Participant.  His Annual Salary Rate
     shall be the rate in effect when he ceased full-time employment.

SECTION 5.  INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENT

5.1  Date and Method of Payment.  Any amount which is payable for any year shall
     be paid to an eligible Participant not later than 3 months of the year
     following the year for which the amount is computed.  The amount of such
     payment shall be paid by check less required withholding for federal,
     state, local and other taxes.  Payments will be made in the same currency
     in which the Employee receives his base salary.

5.2  Beneficiaries.  If a Participant is deceased at the time any payment is
     payable to him, the amount of such payment shall be payable to the same
     person or persons and in the same proportionate amount as shall be payable
     to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of his basic life insurance under the
     Group Insurance Plan of his Employer.

5.3  Lost Participants.  If any payment becomes distributable pursuant to
     Subsection 5.1 and the whereabouts of a Participant (or any beneficiary
     pursuant to Subsection 5.2) is then unknown to the Employer and the
     Employer shall fail to receive a claim for such payment from the person
     entitled thereto (or from any other person validly acting on his behalf),
     then such payment shall 


     be disposed of in an equitable manner as permitted by law under rules
     adopted by the Plan Administrator.

SECTION 6.  MISCELLANEOUS

6.1  Administration of the Plan.  Except as otherwise expressly provided, the
     Plan shall be administered by the Incentive Compensation Review Committee
     ("the Committee"), appointed by the Chairman of the Board, who shall be the
     Plan Administrator and shall be authorized to (a) determine all questions
     arising in the administration of the Plan, (b) establish rules and
     procedures to carry out their duties and responsibilities, (c) delegate
     such duties and responsibilities to other employees of the Employers, and
     (d) do all other acts which in its judgment are necessary for the proper
     administration of this Plan.

6.2  Facility of Payment.  If the Committee shall receive evidence satisfactory
     to it that any Participant or other person entitled to receive a benefit
     under this Plan is physically or mentally incompetent to receive such
     payment and to give a valid release therefor, the Committee at its
     discretion may make payment in one or more of the following ways:  (a)
     directly to such Participant or person, (b) to his legal guardian or
     conservator, or (c) to his spouse or to any other person to be expended for
     his benefit.  The decision of the Committee shall be in each case final and
     binding on all persons in interest.

6.3  Amendment and Termination of Plan.  The Company shall have the power at any
     time and from time to time, by action of its Board of Directors, to amend
     or terminate this Plan; provided, however, that the Committee may also
     amend the Plan so long as such amendment does not change the duties and
     responsibilities of the Committee or the Stock Option and Officers'
     Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and so long as
     the cost of such amendment to the Employers does not exceed $100,000 per
     year.

6.4  Employment Rights.  Participation in the Plan will not give any Employee or
     an Employer any right to be retained in the service of the Company or its
     subsidiaries, nor any right or claim to any payment under the Plan unless
     such right or claim has specifically accrued under the terms of the Plan.

6.5  Action by Employers.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by any
     Employer hereunder may, except as otherwise expressly provided, be taken by
     the Group President or any Vice President of such Employer or by any other
     person designated by the Group President or any Vice President of the
     Employer to act for such Employer.

6.6  Gender and Number.  Where the context permits, words in the masculine
     gender shall include the feminine gender, the plural shall include the
     singular, and the singular shall include the plural.

DIRECTORS' DEF COMP PLAN




                                                                  EXHIBIT 10 (f)

                               CATERPILLAR INC.
               DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN, AS AMENDED
                           (AS OF DECEMBER 11, 1991)


1.   PURPOSE

     The purpose of the Caterpillar Inc. Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan
     (the "Plan") is to provide each eligible member of the Board of Directors
     (the "Board") of Caterpillar Inc. (the "Company") with an opportunity to
     defer the payment of the compensation (excluding expense reimbursements)
     payable from time to time either for services as a Director of the Company,
     including but not limited to annual fees and fees payable for attendance at
     meetings of the Board and of Committees of the Board, or for others
     services performed for or on behalf of the Company ("Compensation").

2.   ELIGIBILITY

     Any member of the Board ("Director") is eligible to participate in the
     Plan.

3.   ELECTION TO DEFER

     In order to participate in the Plan, a Director must make a valid election,
     on or before December 31 of any year, to defer payment of all or a stated
     percentage of the Compensation (but not less than 50% of such Compensation)
     that would otherwise be payable to him during the following calendar year
     and each succeeding calendar year until such Director ceases to be eligible
     to participate in the Plan or until such election is otherwise modified or
     terminated as provided herein (any such Director being hereinafter called a
     "Participant").  Any such election must be made by timely written notice
     delivered to the Director, Compensation and Benefits, of the Company by use
     of the Deferred Compensation Form attached hereto as Exhibit A which shall
     specify the amount deferred and form and time of distribution.

     Any person who shall first become a Director during any calendar year, and
     who was not a Director on the preceding December 31, may elect, before his
     term as a Director begins, to defer payment of all or a stated percentage
     of the Compensation (but not less than 50% of such Compensation) that would
     otherwise be payable to him during the remainder of such calendar year and
     each succeeding calendar year until such election is otherwise modified or
     terminated as provided herein.  Any such election must be made by timely
     written notice delivered to the Director, Compensation and Benefits, of the
     Company by use of such Deferred Compensation Form.

     In the event that a Participant desires to modify the amount of
     Compensation that is being deferred, the Participant may do so by
     delivering a revised Deferred Compensation Form to the Director,
     Compensation and Benefits, of the Company.  Such modified election shall be
     effective for each calendar year following the year in which such Form is
     delivered to the Director, Compensation and Benefits, and until such
     election is modified or terminated as provided herein.

     In the event that a Participant desires to change his choice as to when
     payments from his account commence, as to whether distribution is made in a
     lump sum or in installments or as to the number of installment payments to
     be made, the Participant may do so by delivering a revised Deferred
     Compensation Form to the Director, Compensation and Benefits, of the
     Company; provided that such modified election (a) shall not apply to
     amounts deferred prior to the effective 

 
     date of such modified election unless made prior to the first day of the
     calendar year specified by the Participant under paragraph 6 after the
     close of which year distribution shall commence in the following month of
     January; and (b) shall not accelerate the time when payments from his
     account commence with respect to amounts deferred prior to the effective
     date of such modified election. Such modified election shall be effective
     as of the commencement of the calendar year following the year in which
     such Form is delivered to the Director, Compensation and Benefits, and
     shall remain in effect until such election is modified or terminated as
     provided herein.

     In the event that a Participant should desire to terminate the deferral of
     his Compensation, the Participant must elect to do so by written notice
     delivered to the Director, Compensation and Benefits, of the Company.  Such
     termination shall become effective as of the end of the calendar year in
     which notice of termination is given with respect to Compensation payable
     during subsequent calendar years.  An election to terminate deferral of
     Compensation will be effective for all future calendar years unless a new
     Deferred Compensation Form is completed and delivered to the Director,
     Compensation and Benefits, of the Company.  Amounts credited to the account
     of a Participant prior to the effective date of termination shall not be
     affected by such termination election and shall be paid only in accordance
     with paragraphs 6 and 7 hereof.

4.   AMOUNT OF DEFERRAL

     A Participant may elect to defer all or a specified portion of the
     Compensation (but not less than 50% of such Compensation) payable from time
     to time as a result of his service as a Director.

5.   STATUS OF ACCOUNTS

     All deferred Compensation shall be held in the general funds of the
     Company, but the Company will establish an individual bookkeeping account
     for each Participant to which the deferred Compensation for that
     Participant will be credited.  Deferred Compensation will be credited to
     the individual account of a Participant at the same time that it would
     otherwise have been paid to the Director in the absence of a deferral
     election.  The Company will credit interest to the individual account of a
     Participant on a quarterly basis.  The interest rate will be equal to the
     base corporate lending rate (sometimes referred to as the "prime rate")
     applicable to commercial lending customers of Citibank, N.A., New York, New
     York (or any successor thereto) on the last business day of each calendar
     quarter.  The annual interest rate will be divided by four and applied
     effective the last day of each quarter to the total average daily amount
     (deferred Compensation and accrued interest) in each Participant's account
     in that quarter.  In any calendar quarter in which a Participant does not
     have deferred amounts credited to his account for the entire period of that
     quarter, interest will be credited pro rata based on the number of business
     days that amounts are credited to his account in that quarter compared to
     the total number of business days in that quarter.  

     The deferral of Compensation and the establishment of individual
     bookkeeping accounts shall not be deemed to have created a trust, and no
     Participant shall have any ownership interest in any and interest thereon
     under this Plan shall not be transferrable or assignable.  Each Participant
     will receive an annual report showing the status of his account at the
     close of each calendar year.  

     As an alternative to the crediting of interest to the individual account
     ("interest election"), each Participant may elect to have all or a
     specified percentage of his Compensation treated as though it were invested
     in Company common stock ("stock election").  After the interest or stock
     election has been in effect one year, the Participant may change the
     election with respect to future Compensation but only once in any
     twelve-month period.  If a Participant makes a stock 


     election, dividend equivalents will accrue to the account quarterly and
     will be reinvested and a Participant's account will in all other respects
     reflect share ownership for events such as a stock split but no voting
     rights  will exist.  The number of shares of stock equivalents shall be
     determined by dividing the amount of Compensation (deferred into stock
     equivalents) or dividends credited by the average of the high and low
     prices of Company common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date
     of such deferral or dividend credit (or the next succeeding trading day if
     there is no trading on that date).  A Participant's account will be valued
     based on the average of the high and low prices for Company common stock on
     the New York Stock Exchange as of (a) the last trading day in December
     prior to the January of the year(s) in which distribution occurs or (b) the
     date of the Participant's death (or the next succeeding trading day if
     there is no trading on that date).  Distribution of account balances shall
     be in cash.  All such elections must be made on forms approved by the
     Director, Compensation and Benefits.

6.   DISBURSEMENT SCHEDULES

     Each Participant shall elect on the Deferred Compensation Form one of the
     following options under which deferred Compensation and interest thereon
     will be payable:

          a)   A lump sum payment, or

          b)   Annual installments for a period of up to 10 years

     Each Participant shall elect on the Deferred Compensation Form one of the
     following options as to when the payment of installments will commence, or
     a lump sum payment will be made:

          In January of the first calendar year following:

          a)   the year in which the Participant ceases to be a Director, or

          b)   the year in which the Participant reaches age 72, or

          c)   the year in which the Participant retires from his principal
               occupation.

7.   DEATH OF A PARTICIPANT

     Upon the death of a Participant, the balance in the Participant's account
     (including interest for the elapsed portion of the year of death) shall be
     determined as of the date of death and such balance shall be paid as soon
     as reasonably possible thereafter in a lump sum payment to such beneficiary
     as the Participant shall have designated in writing to the Company and
     filed with its Director, Compensation and Benefits, or in the absence of
     such designation, to the Participant's estate.

8.   AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

     The Board of Directors may at any time amend or terminate this Plan, but no
     amendment or termination will have the effect of reducing the amount that
     any Participant is entitled to receive prior to such amendment or
     termination nor accelerating the distribution of any amount theretofore
     credited to a Participant's account; provided, however, that in the event a
     Participant (or, if applicable, the designated beneficiary) incurs a severe
     financial hardship caused by an accident, illness, or other event beyond
     the control of the Participant (or, if applicable, designated beneficiary)
     the Stock Option and Officers' Compensation Committee of the 


     Company, in its sole discretion, may revise such Participant's (or, if
     applicable, designated beneficiary) payment schedule for distribution from
     the interest account (but not from the stock-equivalent account) to the
     extent reasonably necessary to eliminate such financial hardship.

9.   ADMINISTRATION

     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Plan shall be
     administered under the direction of the Director, Compensation and
     Benefits, of the Company.

DIRECTORS' AWARD PRGRM



                               
                                                                  EXHIBIT 10(h)

                               CATERPILLAR INC.
                      DIRECTORS' CHARITABLE AWARD PROGRAM

1.   PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM

     Under the Caterpillar Inc. Directors' Charitable Award Program (the
     "Program"), Caterpillar Inc. (the "Company") will make a donation of up to
     $1,000,000 on behalf of each eligible Director.  The donation will be made
     by the Company, in the Director's name, in ten equal annual installments,
     with the first installment to be made as soon as is practicable after the
     Director's death.  Of the total donation amount, 50% will be donated to the
     eligible tax-exempt organization(s) (the "Donee(s)") selected by the
     Director, and the remaining portion of the donation will be made to the
     Caterpillar Foundation (the "Foundation").  The purpose of the Program is
     to acknowledge the service of the Company's Directors, recognize the
     interest of the Company and its Directors in supporting worthy educational
     institutions and charitable organizations, provide an additional means of
     support to the Foundation, and enhance the Company's Director benefit
     program so that the Company is able to continue to attract and retain
     Directors of the highest caliber.

2.   ELIGIBILITY

     All persons serving as Directors of the Company as of April 1, 1993, shall
     be eligible to participate in the Program.  All Directors who join the
     Company's Board of Directors after that date shall be immediately eligible
     to participate in the Program upon election to the Board.

3.   DONATION AMOUNT

     While serving as a Director, the donation amount for a Director will be
     determined based on the Director's months of Board service, in accordance
     with the following schedule:


 

                Months of       Selected Charity       Foundation
                 Service            Donation            Donation 
                ---------       ----------------       ----------
                         
               0-11 months         $       0            $      0
               12-23                 100,000             100,000
               24-35                 200,000             200,000
               36-47                 300,000             300,000
               48-59                 400,000             400,000
               60 or more            500,000             500,000
 

     A Director will continue to be eligible to participate in the program after
     he or she terminates Board service.  The total donation amount in effect on
     the date a Director's Board service terminates shall be continued based
     upon his or her months of service on that date.  However, notwithstanding
     this schedule, a Director will be treated as having served for 60 or more
     months if he or she terminates Board service as a result of disability or
     mandatory retirement.

     In determining a Director's total donation amount, Board service prior to
     the effective date of the Program (even if it is not continuous service)
     will be counted.

4.   RECOMMENDATION OF DONATION

     When a Director becomes eligible to participate in the Program, he or she
     shall make a written recommendation to the Company, on a form approved by
     the Company for this purpose, designating the Donee(s) which he or she
     intends to be the recipient(s) of the Company donation to be made on his or
     her behalf.  A Director may revise or revoke any such recommendation prior
     to his or her death by signing a new recommendation form and submitting it
     to the Company.  Each eligible Director may choose one Donee to receive a
     Company donation of $500,000, or up to five Donees to receive donations
     aggregating $500,000.  Each recommended Donee must be recommended to
     receive a donation of at least $100,000.


                                   

5.   TIMING OF DONATION

     The donation made on a Director's behalf will be made by the Company in ten
     equal annual installments, with the first installment to be made as soon as
     is practicable after the Director's death.  The first five installments
     (the Donee installments) will be donated to the Director's selected
     Donee(s), and the last five installments (the Foundation installments) will
     be donated to the Foundation.  If a Director recommends more than one Donee
     to receive a donation, unless otherwise instructed by the Director, each
     will receive a prorated portion of each Donee installment.  Each Donee
     installment payment will be divided among the recommended Donees in the
     same proportions as the total donation amount has been allocated among the
     Donees by the Director.  However, a Director may instruct the Company to
     allocate the installment payments in a different manner.

6.   DONEES

     In order to be eligible to receive a donation, a recommended organization
     must be an educational institution or charitable organization, and must
     initially, and at the time a donation is to be made, qualify to receive
     tax-deductible donations under the Internal Revenue Code.  Also, the
     organization must be reviewed and approved by the Vice President and
     Manager of the Foundation.  An organization will be approved unless it is
     determined, in the exercise of good faith judgment, that a donation to the
     organization would be detrimental to the best interests of the Company. 
     Private foundations (except for the Foundation) are not eligible to receive
     donations under the Program.

7.   FUNDING AND PROGRAM ASSETS

     The Company may fund the Program or it may choose not to fund the Program. 
     If the Company elects to fund the Program in any manner, neither the
     Directors nor their recommended Donee(s) shall have any rights or interests
     in any assets of the Company identified for such purpose.  Nothing
     contained in the Program shall create, or be deemed to create, a trust,
     actual or constructive, for the benefit of a Director or any Donee
     recommended by a Director to receive a donation, or shall give, or be
     deemed to give, any Director or recommended Donee any interest in any
     assets of the Program or the Company.  If the Company elects to fund the
     Program through life insurance policies, a participating Director agrees to
     cooperate and fulfill the enrollment requirements necessary to obtain
     insurance on his or her life.

8.   AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION

     The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time, without the consent
     of the Directors participating in the Program, amend, suspend or terminate
     the Program.

9.   ADMINISTRATION

     The Program shall be administered by the Company.  The Company shall have
     plenary authority in its discretion, but subject to the provisions of the
     Program, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules, regulations and procedures
     relating to the Program.  The determinations of the Company on the
     foregoing matters shall be conclusive and binding on all interested
     parties.

10.  GOVERNING LAW

     The Program shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the
     State of Illinois, and all provisions thereof shall be administered
     according to the laws of said State.

11.  EFFECTIVE DATE

     The effective date of the Program is April 1, 1993.  The recommendation of
     an individual Director will be effective when he or she completes all
     enrollment requirements.

February 11, 1994

To the Participants, Investment
Plan Committee and Benefits Funds
Committee of the Employees' 
Investment Plan for Eligible 
Employees of Caterpillar Inc. 


In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets
available for plan benefits of the Employees' Investment
Plan (for Eligible Employees of Caterpillar Inc.) and the
related statements of changes in net assets available for
plan benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the
net assets available for plan benefits as of November 30,
1993 and 1992, and the changes in net assets available for
plan benefits for the years ended November 30, 1993, 1992
and 1991 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These financial statements are the responsibil-
ity of the plan's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reason-
able basis for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The
additional information included in Schedules I and II is
presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a
required part of the basic financial statements but is
additional information required by ERISA.  Such information
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

                          EMPLOYEES' INVESTMENT PLAN
                  FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF CATERPILLAR INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 - PLAN DESCRIPTION:

The following description of the Caterpillar Inc. Employees'
Investment Plan (Plan) provides only general information. 
Participants should refer to the Plan agreement for a more complete
description of the Plan's provisions.  

General

The Plan is a defined contribution plan established by Caterpillar
Inc. (the Company) to enable eligible employees to accumulate
funds.  Participating employees of the Company may acquire
ownership interests in the Company through purchases of its common
stock (Part I).  Additionally, eligible employees may elect to
defer a portion of their compensation until retirement (Special
Investment Supplement, Part II).  

Participation

Generally, employees other than those employed under collective
bargaining agreements, of participating employer companies meeting
certain age, service and citizen or residency requirements are
eligible to participate in the plan.  Participation commences upon
an eligible employee's filing of an application with the Investment
Plan Committee.  

Participant accounts

Accounts are maintained separately for Part I and Part II for each
participant.  The participant's separate account under Part I is
credited with the participant's contribution, the Company's
contribution and an allocation of Plan earnings.  The participant's
account in Part II of the Plan is credited with the Company's
contribution as defined below, and an allocation of Plan earnings. 
Allocations of earnings are based on participant account balances,
as defined.  The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the
benefit that can be provided from the participant's accounts.  

Loan provisions

The Plan provides for participant loans against eligible
participants' Part II separate account balances.  Eligible
employees obtain participant loans by filing a loan application
with the Company and receiving approval thereof.  Loan amounts are
generally limited to the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of the individual



participant's account balance.  Loan repayment terms may range from
6 to 117 months depending on the type of loan and bear interest at
the prime interest rate plus 1%.  Repayments, including interest,
are made through payroll deductions and are credited to the
individual participant's account balance. 

Contributions

  PART I -

Contributions from employees are made by payroll deduction based on
a percentage (2%-6%) of total earnings as elected by the employee. 
Employees with 25 or more years of service may contribute an
additional 1%-4% of earnings.  

Employer contributions are 50%, 66-2/3% or 80% of employee
contributions (up to 6% of earnings) based on the employee's years
of service.  

  PART II -

The employer contributes the amount of compensation deferral, as
elected by the participating employee, to the Plan.  During 1993,
the reduction in compensation was limited to (a) the greater of
$4,500 or 4% of the employee's compensation (limited by the
Internal Revenue Code to $8,994 in 1993) for participants earning
in excess of $60,530 or (b) $8,994 for participants earning less
than $60,530.  

Investment programs

  PART I -

Employee participants may elect to have their contributions
invested as follows:  (1) 100% in Caterpillar Inc. common stock or
(2) 50% in Caterpillar Inc. common stock and 50% in government
securities.  Employer contributions are invested entirely in common
stock of Caterpillar Inc.  

At November 30, 1993, 13,994 employees are participating in the
Plan of which 2,056 employees have elected the split investment
option.  At November 30, 1992, 14,131 employees participated in the
plan of which 2,134 employees elected the split investment option.

  PART II -

Employees may elect to have contributions on their behalf invested
in any combination of the funds shown on the accompanying
statements of changes in net assets available for plan benefits.  

At November 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively, 11,663 and 11,164
employees participated in the Special Investment Supplement,
Part II.  

 
Transfers of assets between investment funds are recorded net on
the statement of changes in net assets available for plan benefits.

Vesting and distribution
provisions

  PART I -

Participants are fully vested at all times in Caterpillar Inc.
common stock or government securities purchased with employee
contributions.  

Participants begin vesting in shares purchased with employer
contributions generally after completing two years of service with
the Company.  Participants vest at the rate of 33% per year,
resulting in full vesting by participants in employer contributions
after five years of service with the Company.  Any amounts not
vested at withdrawal which are forfeited will be applied to reduce
the amount of future employer contributions to the Plan.  Shares
become fully vested upon retirement, permanent disability or death.

While an employee, a participant may elect to withdraw Company
purchased shares of common stock or his share of the government
securities fund as provided by the Plan.  Upon termination of
employment, participants may elect to receive their shares by
immediate distribution or a deferred distribution.  If termination
is due to retirement or disability, participants may elect various
annuity payments. 

  PART II -

Participants are fully vested in contributions made on their
behalf.  Upon termination of employment for any reason, including
death, retirement or because of total and permanent disability, the
balance or balances in a participant's account is distributable. 

Administration

The Plan is administered by the Investment Plan Committee, which is
responsible for nonfinancial matters and the Benefits Funds
Committee, which is responsible for financial aspects of the Plan. 
Caterpillar Inc. has entered into trust agreements with The First
National Bank of Chicago and The Northern Trust Company to receive
contributions, administer the assets of the trusts and distribute
withdrawals pursuant to the Plan.  

Plan termination

In the event the Plan is terminated or partially terminated, each
participant in Part I shall also have a fully vested interest in
the assets attributable to employer contributions.  



Federal income tax status

The Plan is a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code and
has received a favorable determination letter.  

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
         ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Investments

The Guaranteed Investment Contracts are stated at contract value,
which approximates market, on November 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Other investments are stated at quoted market
prices, or unit values based on quoted market values, at the close
of business on November 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  Income
from investments is recorded as earned.

The statement of changes in net assets available for plan benefits
for the year ended November 30, 1992 combines activity of the
Government Fixed Income Fund prior to July 1, 1992 and activity of
the Preferred Short-Term Government Fund after July 1, 1992. 
Likewise, activity of the Short-Term Investment Fund before July 1,
1992 and activity of the Preferred Money Market Fund after July 1,
1992 are combined.  The investment objectives of the funds combined
are consistent.  

Contributions

Beginning in 1992, contributions to the Caterpillar Common Stock
Fund, under Part I of the Plan, are made in-kind and are recorded
at fair value.  Shares, in the amount of employee and employer
contributions, are purchased by the Company in the open market and
transferred to the Plan.  Prior to 1992, contributions were made in
cash.  

Administrative expenses

Trustee fees and certain investment and administrative costs are
paid by Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries (Company) which have
adopted the Plan.  

NOTE 3 - TRANSFERS BETWEEN PLANS:

In April 1991, transfers of assets occurred between the Caterpillar
Inc. Employees' Investment Plan Part II, the Solar Turbines
Incorporated's Savings and Investment Plan and the Tax Deferred
Savings Plan (for Eligible Employees of Caterpillar Inc.).   The
transfers reflect the cumulative differences in net assets arising
from changes in employee eligibility and transfers of participating
employees between the various companies sponsoring the Plans. 
Transfers between the Plans are reported net on the statement of
changes in net assets available for plan benefits.  



NOTE 4 - EIP II UNIT VALUES:

Part II of the Plan assigns units to participants directing
investments to any of the Preferred Group of Mutual Funds, the
Caterpillar Common Stock Fund and the Stable Principal Fund.  The
unit values assigned by the Plan reflect the current values of the
individual funds.  Total units held (in thousands) by the Plan and
their respective unit values at each month end are shown on
page 13.  

NOTE 5 - MASTER TRUST:

Under a Master Trust agreement with The Northern Trust Company,
Caterpillar Inc.'s Employees' Investment Plan Part II, Solar
Turbines Incorporated's Savings and Investment Plan and the Tax
Deferred Savings Plan (for Eligible Employees of Caterpillar Inc.)
pool their investments in the Caterpillar Inc. Master Trust in
exchange for a percentage of participation in the Trust.  The
components of investment assets of the Master Trust are shown on
the accompanying schedule.  

Effective July 1992, the Master Trust began investing in the
Preferred Group of Mutual Funds which are sponsored by Caterpillar
Investment Management Ltd. (CIML), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company.  The Preferred Group of Mutual Funds comprise the
following:

              Preferred Short-Term Government Fund
              Preferred Money Market Fund
              Preferred Value Fund
              Preferred International Fund
              Preferred Growth Fund
              Preferred Asset Allocation Fund
              Preferred Fixed Income Fund

CIML manages the Preferred Short-Term Government Fund.  All other
funds are managed by unrelated investment managers.  Caterpillar
Securities, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of CIML, distributes the
shares of the mutual funds to the Master Trust.  



The percentage of the Plan's participation in the Master Trust was
determined based on the November 30, 1993 and 1992 market values of
net assets, as accumulated by the Trustee for the investment funds
of each plan.  At November 30, 1993 and 1992, the Plan's pro rata
interest in the quoted market values of net assets of each of the
funds of the Master Trust was as follows:

                                                  November 30,

        Loan Fund                               71.25%    72.87%

The net investment gain or loss of the Master Trust is reflected in
the financial statements of the Plan based on the actual earnings
of each investment fund.  Refer to pages 14 and 15 for an analyses
of the net assets and changes in net assets of the Master Trust as
of November 30, 1993.  

Effective September 1, 1993, the Employees' Investment Plan was
amended to allow retirees or those participants eligible to retire
to transfer funds from Part I of the Employees' Investment Plan to
investment funds within the Master Trust.
