Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  The cash required by the Corporation for working capital, capital expenditures
and dividend payments was generated from operations and, to a lesser extent,
short-term borrowings.  The Corporation expects to continue to satisfy most of
its cash requirements through internally generated funds.  The Corporation's
current ratio was 1.87 in 1993 and 1.79 in 1992, reflecting the Corporation's
highly liquid position and ability to finance its current operations without
significant short-term borrowings.

  Allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by $1.0 million to $4.1 million in
1993 and increased by $2.7 million to $5.1 million in 1992.  These fluctuations
are related to an increase in bad debt expense in 1992 and an increase in
amounts written-off in 1993.  Both of these increases are related to Phar Mor
Stores Inc. filing for bankruptcy during the third quarter of 1992.

  Inventories increased by $1.3 million in 1993 and by $10.9 million in 1992.
These increases were associated with higher production levels to support sales
increases. Average inventory turnover was 4.0 times in 1993 and 4.3 times in
1992.

                                       6

 
Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)

  Bank borrowings were $6.7 million at January 2, 1994 and $7.7 million at
January 3, 1993 which primarily reflect borrowings by the Corporation's United
States operations. Information concerning the Corporation's bank borrowings is
contained in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $2.8 million in 1993 and
increased by $5.5 million in 1992.  The 1993 decrease is primarily due to the
timing of income tax payments by the Corporation's Canadian subsidiary.  The
1992 fluctuation primarily reflected a $7.7 million increase in the provision
for insurance associated with general liability and workers' compensation,
partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in the payroll liability mainly due
to the timing of bonus payments.

  Capital spending decreased in 1993 and increased in 1992.  Purchases of
property, plant and equipment were $41.2 million in 1993 and $44.9 million in
1992.  Spending in 1993 included purchases of machinery and equipment for
productivity increases and quality improvements in stationery products and
lighters; capacity increases in stationery products and new stationery products;
expansions of the Duncan, South Carolina; Fountain Inn, South Carolina;
Clearwater, Florida and Cuautitlan, Mexico facilities and building improvements
for the Gaffney, South Carolina facility.  Spending in 1992 was principally for
productivity increases and quality improvements in stationery products, lighters
and shavers, which included the purchase of approximately 60 new molding
machines; capacity increases in stationery products and the purchase of two
facilities in South Carolina.  1994 capital spending for all of the
Corporation's locations is expected to be lower than the 1993 level.

  In July 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") issued its
final volumetric ranking  of Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") for the
Solvents Recovery Service of New England ("SRSNE") Superfund Site in
Southington, Connecticut.  The Corporation has been notified that it is a PRP at
the Site and has been ranked, by the EPA, number 192 of a total of 1,659 PRPs
named.  This ranking represents less than 1% of the total volume of waste
disposed at the SRSNE Site with the first 191 PRPs representing 90% of the total
volume.

  The Corporation cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup, the
Corporation's share of the total costs or the extent to which contributions will
be available from other parties, the amount of time necessary to complete the
cleanup, or the availability of insurance coverage.  Based on currently
available information, the Corporation believes that its share of the ultimate
cleanup costs at this Site will not have a material adverse impact on the
Corporation's financial position or on its results of operations if such
operations continue at the present level.

  At January 2, 1994 and January 3, 1993, the Corporation carried no long-term
debt. At January 2, 1994, unused lines of credit were $99.7 million and stand-by
letters of credit were $35.5 million, which management believes is more than
adequate to meet the Corporation's current or future requirements.

  During the first quarter of 1994, the Board of Directors voted an 11.1%
increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 per share to a new
rate of $0.20 per share, effective with the dividend paid on January 31, 1994 to
shareholders of record on January 17, 1994.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)

  In 1993, the Corporation amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase
the number of authorized common shares, $1 par value, from 25,000,000 to
50,000,000.

  During the first quarter of 1992, the Corporation paid a special cash dividend
of $0.50 per share, which was in addition to the regular quarterly cash dividend
of $0.14 per share.

  In January 1994, the Corporation concluded negotiations with its unionized
employees, local utilities and local taxing authorities.  Concessions received
through these negotiations will result in a modest, but important, reduction in
future operating costs at its Milford, Connecticut facility.  In addition, the
State of Connecticut has offered the Corporation a $9 million grant and loan
package to offset capital spending for its Milford, Connecticut facility.

  Consistent with common practice, the Corporation self-insures to a degree
against certain types of risk.  The Corporation also has in place risk
management programs other than insurance to minimize exposure to loss.  The
programs remained relatively unchanged from the prior year.  Management believes
its overall risk management and insurance programs are adequate to protect its
assets and earnings against significant loss.

Results of Operations

  In 1993, the Corporation's net sales increased by $21.9 million to $439.3
million due to increased sales of stationery products of $17.1 million, lighters
of $1.3 million and shavers of $4.0 million, partially offset by a decline in
sport products of $0.5 million.  The increase in stationery products primarily
represents an increase in average selling prices of approximately 9% by its
North American operations.  The increase in lighters primarily reflects an
increase in units sold of approximately 3% by its United States operations.  The
shaver increase is attributable to higher average selling prices of
approximately 10% in North America.  This shaver increase is partially offset by
a slight decline in units sold.

  In 1992, the Corporation's net sales increased by $48.2 million to $417.4
million due to increased sales of stationery products of $31.5 million, lighters
of $4.9 million and shavers of $12.5 million, partially offset by a decline in
sport products of $0.7 million.  The increase in stationery products, which
included the incremental sales of Wite-Out products, reflected increased units
sold of approximately 11% and higher average selling prices in the United
States.  One of the Corporation's Mexican subsidiaries also showed improvements
in units sold and higher average selling prices.  The increase in lighters was
primarily attributable to increased units sold of approximately 4% in North
America.  The shaver increase was largely the result of the incremental sales of
twin-blade shavers.

  Net sales of sport products decreased by $0.5 million in 1993 and by $0.7
million in 1992. These reductions reflect a decrease in the number of units sold
of approximately 11% in 1993 and 5% in 1992, and lower average selling prices.
Income before income taxes, extraordinary credit and cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle was $1.6 million in 1993 and $0.2 million in 1992 for
sport products.  The increase in 1993 is related to a reduction in the provision
related to sailboard litigation which is discussed further in Part I, Item 3 -
Legal Proceedings.

  Foreign sales remained relatively flat in 1993, while increasing by
approximately 13% in 1992.  The increase in 1992 primarily reflected increased
sales of stationery products by one of the Corporation's Mexican subsidiaries.

Results of Operations (Continued)

  The Corporation's purchases from Societe BIC, S.A., the Corporation's majority
shareholder, and from other affiliated companies, decreased by $1.8 million to
$42.2 million in 1993 and increased by $2.4 million to $44.0 million in 1992.
The 1993 decrease primarily represents lower inventory purchases from Societe
BIC, S.A.  The 1992 increase reflects higher inventory purchases from Societe
BIC, S.A., partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates. The Corporation
purchases from Societe BIC, S.A. and other affiliated companies, products that
it does not presently manufacture, certain component parts and machinery and
equipment.  Information concerning the Corporation's transactions and balances
with Societe BIC, S.A. and other related parties is contained in Note 15 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.4% in 1993 and by
2.7% in 1992. The 1992 increase primarily reflected improvements in the United
States and Canadian operations.  The improvements in the United States were
principally due to favorable foreign exchange rates associated with imports, and
higher average selling prices in shavers resulting from the incremental sales of
twin-blade shavers. The improvements in the Canadian operations reflected higher
average selling prices in shavers and BIC Wavelengths, and favorable foreign
exchange rates associated with imports.

  Advertising, selling, general and administrative, marketing and research and
development expenses increased by $7.3 million to $133.7 million in 1993 and by
$12.2 million to $126.4 million in 1992.  The 1993 increase reflects higher
selling expenses and an 18% increase in marketing expenses.  These increases are
partially offset by an 8% decrease in general and administrative expenses.  The
increase in selling expense is attributable to higher sales levels.  The
increase in marketing is related to the costs associated with the promotion of
the Corporation's line of twin-blade shavers.  The decrease in general and
administrative expenses reflects a decrease in the provision for general
liability and workers' compensation insurance, relocation costs and bad debt
expense.  These decreases are partially offset by an increase in the
amortization of intangibles associated with the purchase of Wite-Out Products,
Inc.  The 1992 increase included a 23% increase in general and administrative
expenses and a 20% increase in marketing and advertising.  The general and
administrative expense reflected the increase in the provision for general
liability and workers' compensation insurance, relocation costs attributable to
the relocation of the marker division, higher bad debt expense and the
amortization of the intangible assets acquired in  the purchase of Wite-Out
Products, Inc.  The increase in marketing and advertising included the
promotional costs associated with the introduction of the Corporation's line of
twin-blade shavers.  One of the Corporation's Mexican subsidiaries incurred
higher advertising costs, in order to mitigate the effects of increased
competition resulting from the removal of price controls and the easing of
restrictions on foreign imports.

  Other income - net increased by $2.0 million to $4.2 million in 1993 and by
$0.8 million to $2.2 million in 1992. The 1993 fluctuation is due to an increase
in net foreign currency gains and to a reduction in the provision related to the
sailboard litigation which is discussed further in Part I, Item 3- Legal
Proceedings. These fluctuations are partially offset by lower interest income
and higher interest expense. The 1992 fluctuation was primarily due to decreases
in several miscellaneous expense items, none of which was individually
significant. These decreases were partially offset by lower interest income in
the United States.

Results of Operations (Continued)

  The effective tax rate has varied each year as follows:  39.5% in 1993, 40.6%
in 1992 and 42.1% in 1991.  During 1991, the Corporation utilized the tax
benefit of a foreign net tax operating loss carryforward of $1.1 million which
was shown as an extraordinary credit in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

  Income before extraordinary credit and cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle increased by $4.8 million and by $12.9 million in 1993 and
1992, respectively. These increases were primarily due to improvements in core
operations (stationery products, lighters and shavers) in the United States.

  In 1993, net income included a $9.8 million cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle which was entirely related to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."  Refer to New Accounting Standards
below for further discussion.

New Accounting Standards

  Effective January 4, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 ("SFAS 106"), "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The Corporation elected to
recognize the cumulative effects of this obligation on the immediate recognition
basis.  The cumulative effects as of January 4, 1993 of adopting SFAS 106 were
an increase in accrued postretirement costs of $16.2 million and a decrease in
net earnings of $9.8 million, or $0.42 per share.  The adoption of SFAS 106 had
no effect on the Corporation's cash flow.

  Effective January 4, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes."  Under
SFAS 109, the deferred tax provision is determined under the liability method.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on
differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using presently enacted tax rates. There was no material cumulative effect on
the Corporation's financial position or on its results of operations by adopting
SFAS 109.

  The Corporation is required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112 ("SFAS 112"), "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits," by fiscal 1994.  The adoption of SFAS 112 will not have a significant
effect on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or on its results of
operations if such operations continue at the present level.
