     (a)  For 1991 the amounts presented for Air Conditioning Products 
     include the following amounts for Tyler Refrigeration (which was sold 
     on September 30, 1991): sales of $99 million and operating loss of 
     $18 million (including a $22 million loss on the sale).

     (b)  Corporate items include administrative and general expenses, 
     accretion charges on postretirement benefit liabilities, minority 
     interest, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and 
     miscellaneous income and expense.

     The following section summarizes the Company's consolidated results 
of operations and then discusses the results of its three operating 
segments.  The Company's businesses are cyclical.  Air Conditioning 
Products and Plumbing Products are particularly affected by the level of 
residential and commercial building activity.

 1993 Compared with 1992

     U.S. housing starts increased by 7% in 1993 from the 1992 level, which 
was up 18% over 1991 after four consecutive years of decline.  U.S. 
non-residential contract awards increased by 3% in 1993 after five years of 
decline.  The 1993 improvement in housing starts came in the second half of 
the year with third- and fourth-quarter starts up 10% and 12%, 
respectively, over the preceding quarter.  The gain in non-residential 
awards occurred over the last nine months of 1993.  Western European truck 
and bus production declined 29% in 1993 after an 11% decline in 1992.  
However, the rate of decline in the truck market slowed in the fourth 
quarter of 1993.

     Consolidated sales for 1993 were $3.83 billion, an increase of 1% (6% 
excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange) over the $3.79 
billion for 1992.  A sales increase of 11% for Air Conditioning Products  
was partly offset by a sales decline for Transportation Products of 23% 
(16% excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange).  Sales for 
Plumbing Products were flat (but up by 9% excluding the effects of foreign 
exchange).

     Operating income for 1993 was $282 million, a decrease of $18 million, 
or 6% (but an increase of less than 1% excluding the effects of foreign 
exchange), from $300 million in 1992.  The increase in operating income of 
28% for Air Conditioning Products was more than offset by a 53% decrease in 
operating income for Transportation Products.  Plumbing Products' operating 
income was flat (but increased 15% excluding the effects of foreign 
exchange).  The gain for Air Conditioning Products was the result of higher 
volume, increased sales of higher-margin products, the benefits of 
manufacturing improvements, and the effects of restructuring and 
cost-containment efforts undertaken in 1991 and 1992, offset partly by the 
costs of further restructuring in 1993.  For Plumbing Products the effects 
of increased volume for the Far East Group were offset partly by lower 
margins for the U.S. group and lower volumes and unfavorable foreign 
exchange effects for the European group.  Transportation Products' 
operating income decreased primarily as a result of lower volumes due to 
reduced demand in depressed markets in Europe, offset partly by the effects 
of improvements in manufacturing efficiency.

    The domestic portion of Air Conditioning Products is composed of the 
Unitary Products Group, the Commercial Systems Group (excluding Canada), 
and exports from the United States by the International Group.  The 
foreign portion consists of the foreign-based operations of the 
International Group and the Canadian operations of the Commercial Systems 
Group.


    Sales and operating income of Air Conditioning Products both increased 
in 1993 despite the continuing recession in U.S. and Canadian commercial 
new construction and only moderate increase in residential new 
construction in the U.S. and despite the economic decline in Europe.  
Sales of Air Conditioning Products, which accounted for approximately 55% 
of the Company's 1993 sales, increased by 11% (with little effect from 
foreign exchange) to $2,100 million in 1993 from $1,892 million in 1992.  
There was a significant sales increase for each of the three operating 
groups.

    Operating income of Air Conditioning Products increased year to year 
by 28% (with little effect from foreign exchange) to a record high of $133 
million in 1993 from $104 million in 1992.  The increase was attributable 
to gains achieved by all three groups.


    Unitary Products Group

    In 1993 sales of the Unitary Products Group, which accounted for 
approximately 42% of Air Conditioning Products sales, increased by 15% 
over the 1992 sales level.  Residential markets were up 15%, as a result 
of an unusually hot summer in the northern United States and a 7% increase 
in housing starts.  Sales of residential products increased by 18% year 
over year, principally because of higher volumes driven by the improved 
market, increased furnace sales in the replacement market, and a shift in 
the market to more efficient products, offset partly by the continuation 
from 1992 of price degradation due to competitive pressures.  Commercial 
markets for unitary products were up 9% overall from the 1992 markets, as 
the commercial replacement market strengthened further.  New-construction 
activity continued to struggle, however.  Sales of commercial unitary 
products increased by 10% overall, primarily as a result of higher volume 
(driven by the strong replacement market for both light and large 
commercial products); a shift to higher-priced, higher-tonnage products; 
and a gain in market share for light commercial products due to the 
success of the large Voyager products (packaged rooftop air 
conditioners).  As a result of these factors, together with product cost 
improvements, improved labor productivity, and the benefits of 
organizational restructuring which reduced the salaried workforce in 1992, 
the operating income for Unitary Products in 1993 increased by 43% year 
over year.  This improvement was achieved even though 1993 included the 
initial start-up costs of the new national distribution center in St. 
Louis, Missouri, and higher advertising costs.

    Unitary Products' sales increased through the success of new and 
redesigned products introduced recently and improved distribution 
channels.  Commercial products that were introduced included the 
20-to-25-ton Voyager products in 1992, which more than doubled market 
share in that size range; commercial microprocessor-controlled products; a 
line of convertible air handlers; and rooftop and air cooled chiller 
products using more efficient scroll compressors.  Residential products 
introduced included the American-Standard brand outdoor units and new 
lines of luxury and conventional retail residential products.


    Commercial Systems Group

    Sales of the Commercial Systems Group, which accounted for 
approximately 37% of Air Conditioning Products' sales, increased 10%, 
primarily on volume increases for most product lines, especially air 
handling systems and water chillers (principally due to improved 
replacement markets and increased market share), and increased revenue 
from Company-owned sales offices (acquisitions and volume growth).  These 
gains were partly offset by lower volume in Canada, which continues to be 
adversely affected by recession.  The non-residential new-construction 
market increased 3% in the United States in 1993, following decreases of 
5% in 1992 and 17% in 1991.  The non-residential replacement market was up 
by 6% over 1992.

    Operating income for Commercial Systems increased 12% in 1993 over the 
recession-affected amount of 1992.  The increase was primarily the result 
of volume gains, improvements in manufacturing efficiency, operating 
expense reductions, and the benefits of restructuring actions taken in 
1992.  The effects of these factors were partly offset by slightly lower 
prices, increases in material, labor, and benefit costs, the costs of 
additional restructuring actions in 1993, and a larger loss in the weak 
Canadian market.

    Product development emphasis for Commercial Systems in 1993 and 1992 
was on new compressor, heat transfer and microelectronic control 
technology; adaptation of products to refrigerants that comply with recent 
government regulations; energy-efficient products; products for the 
aftermarket and replacement market (which exceeded the new-construction 
market in both 1993 and 1992); and products redesigned to improve 
manufacturing productivity.  This strategy benefited operations in 1993 
and 1992, and the Company expects that this product development emphasis 
will result in greater sales over the next several years.

    International Group

    Sales of Air Conditioning Products' International Group, which 
accounted for approximately 21% of Air Conditioning Products' 1993 sales, 
increased 7% from those of 1992 (10% excluding the unfavorable effect of 
foreign exchange).  Most of the gain was from higher volume in the Far 
East (especially Hong Kong, Taiwan, and export sales from the U.S.) 
resulting from expanded markets and increased penetration; higher export 
sales from the U.S. to the Middle East (markets were significantly 
stronger) and Latin America (improved penetration in a market that was up 
20%); and higher volumes in Mexico.  These gains were partly offset by 
lower sales in Europe (lower prices and volumes in a declining market).   
Markets were down in all European countries except the U.K., but the 
effect was partly offset by increased revenues from service companies 
acquired in 1992 and prior years.  Market growth in the Far East was 6% 
overall, led by the PRC market, which was up by 21%.  The sales growth in 
Hong Kong was driven by the very strong market in the PRC.  Markets in 
Thailand also grew, and the Latin American market grew by 20%.



    Operating income for the International Group increased by 
approximately 39% in 1993.  The increase was primarily the result of 
higher export sales from the U.S. to the Middle East and Far East, offset 
partly by a larger operating loss in Europe primarily because of the weak 
markets and lower margins, costs related to restructuring in response to 
the lower markets, and the unfavorable effects of lower volume on factory 
performance.  Overall, income from the Far East and Latin America was 
essentially unchanged from the prior year, as volume gains were offset by 
increased costs related to expansion of distribution channels and joint 
ventures and development of new and improved products to support present 
and future growth.

and Environmental Matters."

    Backlog

    The worldwide backlog for Air Conditioning Products at the end of 1993 
was $407 million, up 13% from 1992, excluding the effects of foreign 
exchange.  The backlog increased as a result of increased volume for the 
Commercial Systems Group, market penetration and improved distribution 
channels in the Middle East and Far East, and sales growth for commercial 
Unitary Products.

     The foreign portion of Plumbing Products is composed of the European 
Plumbing Products Group, the Americas International Group, and the Far 
East Group.  The domestic portion of sales and operating results is 
generated primarily by the U.S. Plumbing Products Group and by export 
sales from the U.S.

     Sales of Plumbing Products in 1993, at $1,167 million, which 
accounted for approximately 30% of the Company's 1993 sales, were at 
essentially the same level as the $1,170 million of sales in 1992 (but 
increased by 9% excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange).  
Sales increases of 42% for the Far East Group (46% excluding foreign 
exchange), 9% for the Americas International Group (14% excluding foreign 
exchange), and 6% for the U.S. Plumbing Products Group were offset partly 
by a sales decrease of 10% for the European Plumbing Products Group (which 
had a 4% increase excluding the effects of foreign exchange).

     In 1993 operating income of Plumbing Products was $108 million, the 
same amount as in 1992, but excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign 
exchange operating income increased by 15%.  The increase (on an 
exchange-adjusted basis) was attributable primarily to increased 
profitability for the Far East Group and for the Americas International 
Group, offset partly by a decline for the U.S. group.

     European Plumbing Products Group

     Sales of the European group, which accounted for approximately 51% of 
Plumbing Products' sales for 1993, decreased 10% in 1993 from 1992 but 
increased by 4% excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.  
The exchange-adjusted gain resulted from price increases, especially in 
Italy, Germany, the U.K., and Greece, offset partly by lower volume in 
most countries because of depressed markets.  In Italy sales were up with 
price increases for most product lines, offset partly by lower volume and 
a less favorable product mix.  The German market was stable in total, as 
price gains were offset by volume and mix declines.  Greece, which had 
been in recession for three years, recovered somewhat in 1993.  The 
European group's strength has been sales in the replacement market, which 
has more than made up for the effects of poor new-construction markets.

     Operating income for the European group decreased 7% but increased 
10% excluding the effects of foreign exchange.  This increase occurred 
primarily because of the price gains and cost reductions resulting from 
restructuring and efficiency improvements in the U.K., France, Italy, and 
Germany.  Partly offsetting those favorable effects were the effects of 
lower volumes and the unfavorable effect on margins caused by the decline 
in value of many European currencies agains the Deutschemark.  The 
increased cost of fittings purchased from Germany could not be completely 
recovered through sales price increases in most of the operations in other 
countries.

     U.S. Plumbing Products Group

     Sales of the U.S. group, which accounted for approximately 26% of 
total 1993 Plumbing Products sales, increased 6% in 1993.  During 1993 the 
U.S. building industry continued to be adversely affected by the low level 
of new construction, although non-residential construction increased 3% 
from 1992 and new residential construction continued to recover from the 
lowest levels since the mid-1940's (up by 7% in 1993 and 18% in 1992 but 


still below pre-1990 levels).   A basic shift from wholesale distribution 
channels to retail channels has been developing over the last few years, a 
trend the Company believes will continue and will be beneficial to the 
Company because of strong product and brand-name recognition.  Retail 
markets now account for 20% of the total sales of the U.S. group.  The 
growth of sales for the U.S. group was largely the result of increased 
export sales from the U.S. and to a lesser extent price increases on 
certain products, a more favorable sales mix, and a small increase in the 
growing retail channel business.  The overall gain in the retail business 
was small because significant volume gains due to an expanding customer 
base were partly offset by the loss of an important customer.

     The operating loss for the U.S. group in 1993 was greater than that 
of the prior year.  Despite higher sales, operating results were poorer 
primarily because of lower margins on both domestic and export sales, 
increased advertising costs and other expenses associated with expansion 
of the retail distribution channel, costs related to start-up and 
expansion of the low-water-volume toilet line (now mandated for new 
construction), and factory performance problems caused in part by the 
effects of fluctuating volumes.  In addition, costs were incurred in 
business system re-engineeering activities intended to improve customer 
service.

     Americas International and Far East Groups

     Combined sales of the Americas International and Far East Groups, 
which accounted for approximately 23% of total Plumbing Products sales, 
increased 21% in 1993 (26% excluding the effects of foreign exchange).  
The sales gain was due primarily to the consolidation of Incesa (a 
previously unconsolidated group of Central American joint ventures) 
effective January 1, 1993, as a result of the purchase of additional 
shares of stock, and to higher volume and prices in Thailand, the PRC, the 
Philippines, and Brazil, offset partly by decreases in sales in Mexico, 
Canada, and Korea.

     Combined operating income of the Americas International and Far East 
Groups in 1993 increased 72% over the 1992 level.  Gains were realized in 
all operations except Mexican chinaware operations, which were adversely 
affected by poor economic conditions and the uncertainty related to the 
North American Free Trade Agreement.  The increase was primarily from 
higher prices and volumes in Brazil, Thailand, and the PRC the 
consolidation of Incesa, and a smaller loss for Mexican fittings 
operations.

Regulations and Environmental Matters."

     Backlog

     Plumbing Products' year-end 1993 backlog of $143 million was down 9% 
from 1992, excluding foreign exchange effects.  The decrease resulted from 
a significant drop for European Plumbing Products (particularly Italy 
because of economic uncertainty, tempered somewhat by increases for 
England and Germany), and a drop in backlog for export sales from the 
U.S., partly offset by increases in the Far East (primarily Thailand).


Transportation Products Segment

                                Year Ended December 31,

  amortization                 35          37           34

 
     Sales of Transportation Products, which accounted for 15% of the 
Company's 1993 sales, were $563 million, down 23% from $730 million in 
1992 (16% excluding the effects of foreign exchange).  The sales decrease 
was due primarily to a volume decline in Germany as a result of a 29% 
decrease in Western European truck and bus production, led by a 34% 
decline in Germany, and a 23% decrease in Western European trailer 
production.  Volumes were also down in all other European countries in 
which Transportation Products has operations, although at the end of 1993 
sales and order trends were upward.  Volume in Brazil was slightly 
higher.  Original equipment sales volume in Europe was down 22%, and 
aftermarket business was down 10%.  These declines affected both 
conventional and electronic products.

     Operating income for Transportation Products in 1993 decreased 53% 
(50% excluding foreign exchange effects) to $41 million from $88 million 
in 1992, principally because of the lower sales and production volume and 
the inability to pass on material and labor cost increases in a very 
competitive, declining market.  In response to reduced production levels, 
plant employment was reduced by 15%, the costs of which further depressed 
1993 operating income.  Those effects were partly offset by the favorable 
effects of cost improvements in manufacturing from Demand Flow implementa-
tion and reduced operating expenses.

     Despite the market downturn, significant progress was made during 
1993 in obtaining market acceptance of electronically controlled air 
suspension systems for commercial vehicles and for antilock braking 
systems on trailers.

     Backlog

     Transportation Products' year-end 1993 order backlog of $185 million 
was 2% lower than the 1992 year-end backlog, excluding the effects of 
foreign exchange, as a result of the poor market conditions.


 
Financial Review
 
     1993 Compared with 1992

     The Company's financing and corporate costs were $363 million and 
$352 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.  The principal causes of the 
increase were effects of year-to-year changes in foreign exchange 
transaction gains and losses, higher minority interest, lower equity 
income, higher accretion expense on postretirement benefits, and lower 
miscellaneous income.  Interest expense, which accounted for most of these 
costs, decreased primarily because of lower overall interest rates on new 
debt issued as part of the Refinancing (described below), partly offset by 
additional interest expense as a result of the exchange of the 12-3/4%  
Exchangeable Preferred Stock for the 12-3/4% Junior Subordinated 
Debentures.

     The tax provision for 1993 was $36 million despite a pre-tax loss of 
$81 million, whereas in 1992 the tax provision was $5 million on a pre-tax 
loss from continuing operations of $52 million.  The 1993 provision 
reflected taxes payable on profitable foreign operations and was higher 
than in 1992 primarily because no tax benefits were available on domestic 
losses.  The unusual relationship between the pre-tax losses and the tax 
provision is explained by the nondeductibility for tax purposes of the 
amortization of goodwill and other purchase accounting adjustments and the 
share allocations made by the Company's ESOP as well as by tax rate 
differences and withholding taxes on foreign earnings.

     As a result of the Refinancing in 1993 there was an extraordinary 
charge of $92 million related to the debt retired (including call 
premiums, the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs, and loss on 
cancellation of foreign currency swap contracts) on which there was no tax 
benefit.
 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     As a result of the Acquisition the Company's capital structure became 
highly leveraged.  Net cash flow from operations, after cash interest 
expense of $195 million, was $201 million for the year ended December 31, 
1993.  Utilizing this cash flow and cash on hand at December 31, 1992, the 
Company devoted $98 million to capital expenditures, including $8 million 
of investments in affiliated companies, and repaid $50 million of term 
loans.

     In July 1993 the Company completed a refinancing (the "Refinancing") 
that included (a) the issuance of $200 million principal amount of 9-7/8% 
Senior Subordinated Notes Due 2001; (b) the issuance of approximately $751 
million principal amount of 10-1/2% Senior Subordinated Discount 
Debentures Due 2005, which yielded proceeds of approximately $450 million; 
(c) the amendment and restatement of the Company's 1988 Credit Agreement 
(the "1988 Credit Agreement" and as so amended and restated, the "Credit 
Agreement") to establish a $1 billion secured, multi-currency, 
multi-borrower credit facility; and (d) the application of the proceeds of 

such issuances and such borrowings as follows: (i) the redemption on July 
1, 1993, of all of the outstanding 12-7/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures 
Due 2000 at a redemption price of 104.83% ($571.3 million), (ii) the 
redemption on July 2, 1993, of a majority of the outstanding 14-1/4% 
Subordinated Discount Debentures Due 2003 at a redemption price of 105% 
($389.5 million), (iii) the refunding of bank borrowings ($405 million of 
term loans and $77 million of other bank debt including revolving credit 
debt), (iv) the refunding of letters of credit ($58 million), and (v) 
payment of related fees and expenses.

     The Credit Agreement provided to American Standard Inc. and certain 
subsidiaries (the "Borrowers") a $1 billion facility as follows: (a) a 
$250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the "Revolving 
Credit Facility") available to all Borrowers, which expires in 2000; (b) a 
$225 million multi-currency periodic access facility (the "Periodic Access 
Facility") available to all Borrowers, which expires in 2000; and (c) 
three term loan facilities (the "Term Loans") consisting of a $225 million 
U.S. dollar facility available to American Standard Inc., which expires in 
2000; a $200 million Deutschemark facility available to a German 
subsidiary, which expires in 1997; and a $100 million U.S. dollar facility 
available to all Borrowers, which expires in 1999.  In August 1993 the 
Company repaid $50 million, and the amount available under the Credit 
Agreement by its terms was reduced to $950 million.

     The Company is required to reduce to $50 million the amount of 
borrowings outstanding under the Revolver for at least 30 consecutive days 
in each 12-month period ending May 31.  In December 1993 the Company met 
this requirement for the 12 months ending May 31, 1994.  Commencing August 
31, 1994, the Revolver is reduced by $8.3 million annually, with a final 
maturity on June 1, 2000.  In addition, the Company is required to repay 
the full amount of each of its outstanding revolving loans at the end of 
each interest period (a maximum of six months).  The Company may, however, 
immediately reborrow such amounts subject to compliance with applicable 
conditions of the Credit Agreement.

     The Credit Agreement provides the Company with increased operating 
and financial flexibility, including the ability to shift from time to 
time a portion of borrowings among borrowers and currencies.  As a result 
of the Refinancing there was a significant reduction in annual interest 
expense, which was partly offset by additional interest expense on the 
12-3/4% Junior Subordinated Debentures exchanged for the 12-3/4% 
Exchangeable Preferred Stock.  The Company believes that the amounts 
available from operating cash flows and under the Revolving Credit 
Facility will be sufficient to meet its expected cash needs, including 
planned capital expenditures.

     As described in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, 
the Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit, among other 
things, indebtedness, dividends on and redemptions of capital stock of the 
Company, purchases and redemptions of other indebtedness of the Company 
(including its outstanding debentures and notes), rental expense, liens, 
capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, disposal of assets, the 
use of proceeds from asset sales, and certain other business activities 
and require the Company to meet certain financial tests.  In order to 


maintain compliance with the covenants and restrictions contained in the 
1988 Credit Agreement, the Company from time to time has had to obtain 
waivers and amendments.  In February 1994 the Company obtained an 
amendment to the Credit Agreement that among other things relaxed certain 
financial tests and convenants, and facilitated the investment in an air 
conditioning joint venture and the formation of a holding company to 
establish joint ventures in the People's Republic of China for the 
manufacture and sale of plumbing products.  The Company currently believes 
it will comply with the amended financial tests and covenants but may have 
to obtain similar amendments or waivers in the future.

     On June 30, 1993, in exchange for all of the Company's outstanding 
shares of 12-3/4% Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the Company issued $141.8 
million of 12-3/4% Junior Subordinated Debentures Due 2003 to the holder 
of the Exchangeable Preferred Stock.  Those debentures were sold by the 
holder in a registered public offering in August 1993.  The Company 
received none of the proceeds of this offering.

     The indentures related to the Company's debentures and notes contain 
various covenants which, among other things, limit debt and preferred 
stock of the Company and its subsidiaries, dividends on and redemption of 
capital stock of the Company and its subsidiaries, redemption of certain 
subordinated obligations of the Company, the use of proceeds from asset 
sales, and certain other business activities. 

     In connection with examinations of the tax returns of the Company's 
German subsidiaries for the years 1984 through 1990, the German tax 
authorities have raised questions regarding the treatment of certain 
significant matters.  The Company has paid approximately $20 million of a 
disputed German income tax.  A suit is pending to obtain a refund of this 
tax. The Company anticipates that the German tax  authorities may propose 
other adjustments resulting in additional taxes of approximately $105 
million, plus penalties and interest for the tax return years under 
audit.  In addition, significant transactions similar to those which gave 
rise to such possible adjustments occurred in years subsequent to 1990.  
The Company, on the basis of the opinion of legal counsel, believes the 
tax returns are substantially correct as filed and intends to vigorously 
contest any adjustments which have been or may be assessed.  Accordingly, 
the Company had not recorded any loss contingency at December 31, 1993, 
with respect to such matters.  Under German tax law the authorities may 
demand immediate payment of a tax assessment prior to final resolution of 
the issues.  The Company also believes, on the basis of opinion of legal 
counsel, that it is highly likely that a suspension of payment will be 
obtained if additional taxes are assessed.  However, if payment is 
required the Company expects that it will be able to meet such payment 
from available sources of liquidity or credit support but that future cash 
flows and capital expenditures, and therefore subsequent results of 
operations for any particular quarterly or annual period, could be 
adversely affected.


Capital Expenditures

     The Company's capital expenditures for 1993 amounted to $98  million, 
including investments of $8  million in affiliated companies.  The amount 


of capital expenditures was $10 million less than in 1992 ($6 million less 
excluding the effects of foreign exchange).  Decreases in  capital 
spending by Plumbing Products and Transportation Products were partly  
offset by an increase in spending by Air Conditioning Products.  The 
Company believes capital spending was sufficient for maintenance purposes, 
for important product and process redesigns, for expansion projects, and 
for strategic investments.

     Capital expenditures by Air Conditioning Products were $38 million in 
1993.  This amount was 15% more than that of 1992.  Capital expenditures 
in 1993 included continuing projects related to Demand Flow and spending 
on new products such as the Voyager III (medium-tonnage product line), the 
scroll compressor, and the Series R chiller line, expansion of Voyager I 
and Voyager II capacity and tooling and equipment for the American 
Standard product line.

     Plumbing Products' capital expenditures in 1993 were $46 million, 
including investments of $8 million in affiliated companies in France 
(Porcher) and the Czech Republic.  Excluding the investments in affiliated 
companies and the effects of foreign exchange, capital spending was 34% 
higher than in 1992 as a result of spending increases in Europe and the 
Far East.  Major projects included capacity expansion in Thailand and 
China and various projects related to Demand Flow implementation. 

     Capital expenditures for Transportation Products totaled $14 million 
in 1993.  Excluding the effects of foreign exchange, capital spending was 
41% less than in 1992, a year with significant spending related to Demand 
Flow cost-reduction projects in production and material flow. 

 
1992 Compared with 1991

    U.S. housing starts increased by 18% in 1992 from the 1991 level, but 
non-residential contract awards decreased by 5%.  Both of these economic 
indicators had declined in each of the previous four years.

    Consolidated sales for 1992 were $3.8 billion, an increase of 5% (4% 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign exchange) over the $3.6 billion 
for 1991.  The 1991 amount included the sales of Tyler Refrigeration, 
which was sold September 30, 1991.  Excluding Tyler Refrigeration, sales 
in 1992 were up 8% (7% excluding foreign exchange effects).  Sales 
increases of 15% for Plumbing Products and 9% for Air Conditioning 
Products (excluding Tyler Refrigeration) were partly offset by a sales 
decline for Transportation Products of 1% (6% excluding the favorable 
effects of foreign exchange).

    Operating income for 1992 was $300 million, an increase of $58 
million, or 24% (19% excluding the effects of foreign exchange), from $242 
million in 1991.  The 1991 amount included a loss for Tyler 
Refrigeration.  Excluding Tyler Refrigeration, operating income in 1992 
was up 15% (10% excluding foreign exchange effects.)  Increases in 
operating income of 42% for Air Conditioning Products (excluding Tyler 
Refrigeration) and 64% for Plumbing Products were partly offset by a 27% 
decrease in operating income for Transportation Products.


    Except as otherwise indicated, the following discussion, including the 
financial comparisons, does not include the results of Tyler Refrigeration 
or the $22 million loss on the sale of Tyler Refrigeration in 1991.
 
Air Conditioning Products Segment
 
    Sales of Air Conditioning Products, which accounted for approximately 
50% of the Company's 1992 sales, increased by 9% to $1,892 million in 1992 
from $1,737 million in 1991.  There was a significant sales increase for 
each of the three operating groups -- for the Unitary Products Group in 
both residential and commercial products primarily because of higher 
volume and more favorable product mix (partly offset by lower prices), for 
the Commercial Systems Group primarily because of higher volume and 
prices, and for the International Group principally because of increased 
volume in Europe and the Far East.

    Operating income of Air Conditioning Products increased year to year 
by 42% (with little effect from foreign exchange) to $104 million in 1992 
from $73 million in 1991.  The increase was attributable to the sales 
gains, the benefits of manufacturing improvements and restructuring and 
cost containment in the Unitary Products and Commercial Systems Groups, 
and the fact that in 1991 results of the Commercial Systems Group had been 
adversely affected by a 54-day work stoppage at its LaCrosse, Wisconsin, 
facility.  The impact of these factors was partly offset by a margin 
decline for the International Group and costs related to the start-up of 
new facilities, sales offices, and distribution channels.


    Unitary Products Group

    Sales in 1992 of the Unitary Products Group, which accounted for 
approximately 41% of Air Conditioning Products sales, increased by 6% over 
the 1991 sales level.  Commercial markets for unitary products were up 6% 
overall from the depressed 1991 markets, as a very strong commercial 
replacement market more than offset the effects of low new-construction 
activity.  Sales of commercial unitary products increased by 7% overall, 
primarily as a result of higher volume (driven by the strong replacement 
market), a shift to higher-priced, higher-tonnage products, and a gain in 
market share for light commercial products.  Residential markets were down 
3.5%, as poor replacement activity, a result of an unseasonably cool 
summer, more than offset the 18% increase in new housing starts.  Despite 
this poorer market, sales of residential products increased by 5% year 
over year, principally because of larger market share, improved furnace 
markets, and a partial shift in the market to more efficient products 
stimulated by Federal standards, offset partly by price degradation due to 
competitive pressures.  As a result of these factors, together with 
benefits of manufacturing improvements, cost containment, and 
organizational restructuring which reduced the salaried workforce, the 
operating profit for Unitary Products in 1992 increased by 50% from the 
depressed level of 1991.


    Commercial Systems Group

    Sales of the Commercial Systems Group, which accounted for 
approximately 38% of Air Conditioning Products' sales, increased 9% 
primarily on volume increases in aftermarket replacement and parts sales, 
increased revenue from Company-owned sales offices (volume growth and 
acquisitions), and small price increases on most product lines.  Other 
factors contributing to the increase were higher sales of large applied 
systems and the fact that in 1991 there was a 54-day work stoppage at the 
LaCrosse, Wisconsin, plant.  These gains were partly offset by lower 
volume in Canada, which was adversely affected by recession.

    Operating income for Commercial Systems increased 129% in 1992 over 
the recession-affected and work-interrupted level of 1991.  The increase 
was primarily the result of the volume and price gains, improvements in 
manufacturing efficiency, cost containment and restructuring, and the fact 
that 1991 included the adverse impact of the LaCrosse work stoppage.  The 
effects of these factors were partly offset by slightly lower gross 
margins, as the price increases did not completely recover increases in 
material, labor and benefits costs.

    International Group

    Sales of Air Conditioning Products' International Group, which 
accounted for approximately 21% of Air Conditioning Products' 1992 sales, 
increased 15% from those of 1991 (10% excluding the favorable effect of 
foreign exchange).  Most of the gain was from higher volumes in Mexico 
(two new sales offices resulted in expanded distribution and penetration), 
the Far East (especially Hong Kong and Singapore), the Middle East 
(markets were significantly stronger), and Europe (sales of new products 
and increased penetration despite declining markets).  Markets were down 
in almost all European countries except Italy, with the largest drop in 
the U.K., offset partly by increased revenues from acquired service 
companies.

    Operating income for the International Group decreased by 
approximately 68% in 1992.  The decline occurred in Europe, primarily 
because of the weak markets and lower prices, costs related to the 
start-up of new facilities and new distribution networks in the U.K. and 
France, costs related to the introduction of new products, start-up costs 
of a company in Spain acquired near the end of 1991, and foreign exchange 
transaction losses from currency fluctuations in the latter half of 1992.  
Income from the Far East and Latin America was essentially unchanged from 
the prior year, as volume gains were offset by increased costs related to 
expanded distribution channels, start-up of new joint ventures, and 
development of new and improved products to support present and future 
growth.

 
Plumbing Products Segment
 
     Sales of Plumbing Products, which accounted for approximately 31% of 
the Company's 1992 sales, increased by 15% in 1992 (14% excluding the 
effects of foreign exchange) to $1,170 million from $1,018 million in 
1991.  The improvement resulted from sales increases of 9% (7% excluding 
the effects of foreign exchange) for the European Plumbing Products Group, 
21% for the U.S. Plumbing Products Group, 4% for the Americas 
International Group (7% excluding foreign exchange), and 101% for the Far 
East Group (98% excluding foreign exchange).

     In 1992 operating income of Plumbing Products increased 64% (56% 
excluding the effects of foreign exchange) to $108 million from $66 
million in 1991.  The increase was attributable primarily to increased 
profitability for the European group on higher prices and volumes 
(especially in Italy and Germany) although improved results in the U.S., 
Americas International, and Far East groups contributed.

     European Plumbing Products Group

     Sales of the European group, which accounted for approximately 57% of 
Plumbing Products' sales for 1992, increased 9% in 1992 over 1991, 7% 
excluding the favorable effects of foreign exchange.  The gain resulted 
primarily from price and volume increases, especially in Italy and 
Germany, offset partly by lower volume in France from declining demand and 
lower prices in the U.K. caused by a very poor market.  In Italy sales 
were up 9%, with gains for most product lines in price, volume and market 
share.  The gains in Germany were the result of higher volumes and prices 
for brass fittings and luxury chinaware.

     Operating income for the European group increased 28% (23% excluding 
the effects of foreign exchange) primarily from the price and volume gains 
in Italy and Germany and higher margins on German brass operations 
resulting from improved manufacturing processes and cost containment, 
offset partly by lower profitability in France because of decreased volume 
and in the U.K. because of the recession.  A recession depressed operating 
results in Greece.

     U.S. Plumbing Products Group

     Sales of the U.S. group, which accounted for approximately 24% of 
total 1992 Plumbing Products sales, increased 21% in 1992.  During 1992 
the U.S. building industry continued to be severely affected by the low 
level of new construction, with non-residential construction down 5% from 
1991 and with new residential construction recovering from the lowest 
levels since the mid-1940's (though up by 18%, it was still low in 
historical terms).  The U.S. market for plumbing products was up an 
estimated 3% to 4%, with more than half the gain occurring in the 
replacement and remodeling markets, which accounts for about 60% of the 
total U.S. market.  The growth of sales for the U.S. group was largely a 
result of the strength of retail business (which had a significant 


increase in volume and accounted for 20% of sales of the U.S. group in 
1992) and increased export sales from the U.S., together with smaller 
gains resulting from price increases and higher wholesaler distribution 
sales.  Sales of AMERICAST products more than doubled in 1992, and smaller 
volume gains were achieved for acrylic products, fixtures, and faucets.

     The operating loss for the U.S. group in 1992 was less than that of 
the prior year.  The improvement was primarily due to price increases and 
secondarily to volume and margin gains (as a result of sourcing product 
from the Company's Latin American plants), offset partly by non-recurring 
costs related to implementation of improved manufacturing processes and 
the effects of a shift in overall sales mix from commercial and luxury to 
lower-margin products.

     Americas International and Far East Groups

     Combined sales of the Americas International and Far East Groups, 
which accounted for approximately 19% of total Plumbing Products sales, 
increased 26% in 1992 (28% excluding the effects of foreign exchange).  
The sales gain was due primarily to the consolidation in 1992 of a 
previously unconsolidated joint venture in Thailand and to a lesser extent
to price and volume increases in Mexico and Korea and higher volumes in 
Brazil, offset partly by lower sales in Canada, which were adversely 
affected by severe recession.

     Combined operating income of the Americas International and Far East 
Groups  in 1992 increased 134% over the 1991 level.  Gains were realized 
in all operations except Canada and the Philippines, both of which were 
adversely affected by poor economies.  The increase was primarily from 
price and volume gains in Mexico and Korea, higher volume and margins in 
Brazil, and higher volume in China.
 
Transportation Products Segment

     Sales of Transportation Products, which accounted for 19% of the 
Company's 1992 sales, were $730 million, down 1% from $741 million in 1991 
(6% excluding the effects of foreign exchange).  The sales decrease was 
due primarily to a volume decline in Germany as a result of a significant 
decrease in truck and bus production.  Volumes were also down in nearly 
all other European countries in which Transportation Products has 
operations except the U.K.  There was also a decline in prices of 
electronic control products, primarily as a result of industry cost 
reductions.

     Operating income for Transportation Products in 1992 decreased 27% 
(32% excluding foreign exchange effects) to $88 million from $121 million 
in 1991, principally because of the lower sales and production volume, 
lower prices, and increased spending for product engineering.  Plant 
employment was kept in line with reduced production levels, but the costs 
associated with these reductions also depressed 1992 operating income.  
Those effects were partly offset by the favorable effects of cost 
reductions and increases in efficiency achieved in manufacturing 
operations.


 
Financial Review
 
     1992 Compared with 1991

     The Company's financing and corporate costs were $352 million and 
$330 million in 1992 and 1991, respectively.  The principal causes of the 
increase were year-to-year effects of changes in foreign exchange 
transaction gains and losses, higher minority interest, and lower 
miscellaneous income.  Interest expense and accretion expense on 
postretirement benefits, which accounted for most of these costs, also 
increased.

     The tax provision for 1992 was $5 million despite a pre-tax loss of 
$52 million, whereas in 1991 the tax provision was $23 million on a 
pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $88 million.  The 1992 
provision reflected taxes payable on profitable foreign operations offset 
partly by available domestic tax benefits.  The 1992 provision was lower 
than in 1991 primarily because of lower pre-tax earnings in foreign 
operations.  In 1992 the provision was also lower because of future income 
tax benefits resulting from carrybacks of foreign net operating losses and 
the existence of deferred tax credits which reverse in the carryforward 
period applicable to other foreign net operating losses.  The unusual 
relationship between the pre-tax losses and the tax provision is explained 
by the nondeductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of goodwill 
and other purchase accounting adjustments and the share allocations made 
by the Company's ESOP as well as by tax rate differences and withholding 
taxes on foreign earnings.
