ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 
Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results
 
You should read
the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in
this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
factors, including those set forth under  Risk Factors.
 
Overview
 
Abtech Holdings was
incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 13, 2007 under the name “Laural Resources, Inc.” On February 10, 2011,
Abtech Holdings consummated the Merger with AbTech Industries, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Prior to the Merger, Abtech Holdings
was a development stage company engaged in the business of acquiring and developing mineral properties, and a public reporting
“shell company,” as defined in SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result of the Merger, Abtech Holdings acquired
all of the issued and outstanding common stock of AbTech Industries (through a reverse acquisition transaction) in exchange for
the stockholders of AbTech Industries acquiring a 78% ownership interest in Abtech Holdings, AbTech Industries became Abtech Holdings’
majority-owned subsidiary, and Abtech Holdings acquired the business and operations of AbTech Industries.
 
This “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is based on and relates only to AbTech Industries.
Prior to the consummation of the Merger, Abtech Holdings was a “shell company” that did not have an active business
and its results of operations are immaterial and are not included in the discussion below. Key factors affecting AbTech Industries’
results of operations during the periods covered in this section include revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income,
and taxation.
 
For accounting purposes,
the Merger transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with AbTech Industries as the acquirer. The consolidated
financial statements of Abtech Holdings included in this annual report on Form 10-K represent a continuation of the financial statements
of AbTech Industries, with one adjustment, which is to retroactively adjust the legal capital of AbTech Industries to reflect the
legal capital of Abtech Holdings. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
 
Results of Operations
 
Comparison of the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010
 
Revenues increased
by approximately 24% in 2011 but continued to be adversely impacted by the effects of a worldwide economic downturn that stalled
most projects with municipal and other customers. Going forward the Company expects significant sales growth due to improving general
economic conditions, maturity of the market for stormwater products, strategic alliances with market dominant strategic partners
and an expansion into new markets for produced water and other industrial applications of the Smart Sponge technology. The Company’s
new distributor, Waste Management, Inc. (“WMI”), announced in April 2011 that it was launching its entry into the stormwater
market and intended to initiate its sales efforts in four pilot market areas in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, WMI had identified
and launched sales efforts in three of these pilot areas. While the Company has not yet recognized significant revenue from this
distribution arrangement, gradual revenue growth is anticipated in 2012 as the Company and WMI pursue these initial efforts in
the pilot market areas and expand into other geographic markets.
 
The sales in both 2011
and 2010 were affected by non-recurring, unusual items. In 2011, the Company recorded approximately $77,000 of revenue resulting
from the forfeiture of a prepayment made by a distributor in 2007 to secure exclusive geographic marketing rights under a distribution
agreement. Under the terms of the distribution agreement, the distributor was allowed to apply the prepaid fee to purchases of
AbTech Industries products for a limited period of time. As of December 31, 2011, the distributor forfeited the $77,000 unused
balance of the prepayment and the Company recorded it as revenue. In 2010, approximately 23% of sales were attributable to the
sale of Smart Sponge products to one customer who donated the products for deployment in the Gulf of Mexico to treat the massive
oil spill that occurred there during the year.

These unusual transactions
in 2011 and 2010 had a favorable impact on gross margins. However, the gross margins of 14.7% and 9.7% for 2011 and 2010, respectively,
are well below the gross margins that we would expect if the Company were operating near full capacity. Our current manufacturing
facility is capable of producing sufficient products to generate approximately $10 million in revenue per year. If the Company
can spread the overhead costs of operating the facility over a larger base of produced products, the margins would be expected
to improve significantly. We do not currently have plans to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, and we anticipate that the excess
capacity will continue to adversely affect gross margins for at least a portion of 2012.
 
The cost of the primary
raw materials used to manufacture the Company’s products is directly affected by the cost of oil. Accordingly, fluctuations
in the price of oil could have a material impact on the cost of manufacturing Smart Sponge products.
 
Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased by $754,363 (32%) in 2011, compared to 2010, due in part to the legal, accounting and other costs
associated with the merger of Abtech Holdings and AbTech Industries which closed in February, 2011. The Company also experienced
new costs related to being a public company including legal fees, auditing fees, and other compliance costs. In 2011, the Company
began a significant expansion of its business development efforts in line with its strategy of developing alliances with companies
that have dominant positions in the specific industry segments targeted by AbTech Industries for distribution of Smart Sponge products.
These efforts included increased cost for personnel, advertising, travel, legal and other promotional costs.
 
Research and development
efforts in 2010 were focused primarily on attempts to modify Smart Sponge products for easy and effective deployment in treating
the Gulf oil spill. In 2011, the Company shifted its R&D focus to new products using the Smart Sponge technology in applications
for the treatment of produced water, and other industrial applications. These efforts involved a significant amount of product
testing in the lab and in the field with corresponding increased costs for personnel (employees and consultants), fees for lab
analysis, equipment rental and travel costs. The increased R&D activities in 2011 resulted in R&D costs increasing to $634,109,
a 26% increase over R&D costs in 2010.
 
Interest expense increased
from $115,568 in 2010 to $2,078,704 in 2011 due largely to a non-monetary, non-recurring charge of $1,620,955 for imputed interest
on promissory notes that were converted to common stock on beneficial conversion terms during 2011. (See NOTE 13 – DEBT REPAYMENT
in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.) In addition, the convertible promissory
notes issued by the Company during 2011 in the July Offering and the September Offering (see NOTE 14 – PRIVATE PLACMENTS
in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K) have interest rates of twelve percent
(12%). The interest expense accrued on these notes in 2011 amounted to approximately $126,000. Interest expense was further impacted
by the amortization of the deferred charges and imputed note discounts for warrants related to these offerings, that were charged
to interest expense in 2011 and amounted to approximately $125,000 and $160,000, respectively.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

 
To date, the Company
has not generated sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and continues to operate with negative cash flow. At December
31, 2011, our cash balance was $1,386,502, significantly higher than the $4,123 balance reported at December 31, 2010, but representing
only approximately 4 months of historical negative cash flows from operations. While we expect to achieve significant sales growth
over the long-term, continued negative cash flow from operations is expected in the short term.

Operations in 2011
and 2010 were funded primarily by proceeds from the issuance of AbTech Industries convertible promissory notes (the “AbTech
Notes”), short-term loans, Abtech Holdings convertible notes and warrants (the “ABHD Notes”), AbTech Holdings
secured convertible promissory notes and warrants (the “Secured Notes’) and equity investments of $2,320,000 pertaining
to the funding requirement of the Merger. These proceeds amounted to $7,322,100 in 2011 and $2,827,865 in 2010. Of the proceeds
received in 2011, $500,000 was received from a director of the Company who also was paid $200,000 for repayment of a non-interest
bearing convertible note issued by AbTech Industries in 2008. The AbTech Notes are convertible into shares of AbTech Industries’
Series A preferred stock at a conversion rate of $3.75 per share. The Series A preferred stock is convertible into shares of Abtech
Holdings common stock at a rate of 5.32 shares of Abtech Holdings common stock for each share of AbTech Industries Series A preferred
stock. At December 31, 2011, the principal amount of debt outstanding was $6,946,524, of which $4,700,000 pertains to ABHD Notes
and Secured Notes with maturity dates in 2012. In the event that the holders of these notes elect to not convert the notes to ABHD
stock at maturity, the Company will be required to raise additional capital in 2012 to repay the notes at maturity or extend the
debt maturity dates and incur higher interest rates on the debt. Under the terms of the ABHD Notes and the Secured Notes, the Company
may extend the maturity dates by an additional ninety (90) day period (the “First Extension Option”), during which
period the interest rate will increase from twelve percent (12%) to fifteen percent (15%) per annum on the unpaid principal of
the notes. The Company may also extend the maturity dates by a second additional 90 day period (the “Second Extension Option”)
during which period the interest rate will increase to eighteen percent (18%) per annum on the unpaid principal of the notes.
 
In February 2012, the
Company completed the final closing of the private offering of Secured Notes and received $2.6 million (less closing costs) for
the additional Secured Notes sold.
 
Our balance sheet at
December 31, 2011 shows approximately $528,000 of inventory, a relatively large amount compared to net revenues for 2011 of $537,152.
This supply of inventory on hand will mitigate some of the working capital requirements AbTech Industries will encounter in the
event it successfully increases sales revenue in 2012. At December 31, 2011, AbTech Industries had customer deposits of $38,505
as prepayments by certain distributors for future product orders. Future sales to these distributors will not generate positive
cash flow until the prepayments are depleted.
 
The Company had capital
expenditures of $11,606 in 2011 and $15,596 in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no commitments for future capital
expenditures. However, if the Company is successful in achieving significant sales growth in 2012, it may need to expand its manufacturing
capacity or outsource some of its manufacturing. The Company is currently considering both options. The Company estimates that
it could double its current manufacturing capacity for approximately $250,000 and accommodate an annual sales rate of over $20
million.
 
Contractual Obligations
 
As a smaller reporting
company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, Abtech Holdings is not required to provide the information required by this
item.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We have not entered
into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have not
entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder’s equity or that are not
reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred
to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity, or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable
interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit support to us or engages in leasing,
hedging, or research and development services with us.
 
Critical Accounting Policies 
 
Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, including the discussion on liquidity and capital resources, are
based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing
basis, management re-evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various
other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given individual estimate
or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could
develop different estimates. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The going concern basis
of presentation assumes we will continue in operation throughout the next fiscal year and into the foreseeable future and will
be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Certain conditions,
discussed above, currently exist which raise substantial doubt upon the validity of this assumption. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the uncertainty.
 
The methods, estimates,
interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results
that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity’s most critical accounting policies
to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity’s financial condition and results of operations
and those that require the entity’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain when estimated.
 
Our critical accounting
policies include fair values of financial instruments, inventory valuation, revenue and cost recognition, allowance for doubtful
accounts, stock-based compensation, accounting for conversion options, common stock purchase warrants, imputed interest and business
combinations and are discussed in detail in the financial statements filed herewith, as are recent accounting pronouncements.
