ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.
 
  Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and
results of operations set forth below should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and the related notes shown in
the index on page 17 of this report.
 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
 
  Weakened market conditions in some of the markets in which the Company
operates, particularly in the aerospace and process industries, have resulted
in recent declines in sales and income.
 
  In November 1993, the Company completed a broad strategic review and
announced a plan intended to enhance shareholder value over the long term. From
an operational point of view, the Company will seek to increase the
profitability of its existing businesses through (i) growth and reinvestment,
particularly in its electro-mechanical, specialty metal and water filtration
operations, (ii) continued emphasis on controlling costs and (iii) an increased
focus on foreign sales, especially in the Pacific Rim and Europe, through a
combination of direct selling efforts and joint ventures. The Company also
intends to pursue strategic acquisitions on a selective basis.
 
  From a financial point of view, the Company's plan, which takes advantage of
the Company's historically strong cash flow, involves repurchasing outstanding
shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $150
million and refinancing existing debt with the net proceeds from the March 1994
$150 million public offering of 9 3/4% senior debt securities, borrowings under
a new bank credit agreement, and available cash. The resulting increased
leverage will reduce the Company's financial and operating flexibility.
Accordingly, the plan also called for a reduction in the quarterly per share
dividend rate on the Company's Common Stock from $.17 to $.06 beginning with
the dividend which was payable on December 24, 1993, and a decrease in the
Company's leverage over time.
 
BUSINESS RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER UNUSUAL CHARGES
 
  In 1993, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $54.9 million ($33.5 million
after tax, or $.77 per share) for costs associated with resizing and
restructuring several of its businesses and other unusual expenses. Of the
$54.9 million total charge, $46.9 million ($28.6 million after tax, or $.66 per
share), was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1993. The total charges, on a
pre-tax basis, were for (1) work force reductions, both planned and those which
occurred in 1993 (including certain pension-related costs) ($21.4 million); (2)
asset write-downs ($15.0 million); (3) the relocation of certain product lines
from a Precision Instruments facility in Sellersville, Pennsylvania and the
overall consolidation of the Company's aerospace operations ($14.2 million);
and (4) other unusual expenses ($4.3 million). The charges for resizing and
restructuring are primarily related to the Company's Sellersville operations
and result from actions taken or planned due to the unwillingness of the union
at such facility to agree on wage and work rule concessions requested by the
Company necessary to make that operation competitive. Also, the Company has
reached an agreement regarding the prepayment premiums to be paid for early
retirement of existing debt and will record an extraordinary charge, (estimated
as of December 31, 1993), of approximately $13 million (after tax), subject to
an interest rate adjustment, in the first quarter of 1994 after completion of
the sale of the senior public notes and the retirement of existing debt.
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992
 
 Results of Operations
 
  Sales for 1993 were $732.2 million, a decrease of $37.4 million or 4.9% from
1992. The sales decrease was attributable to reduced domestic and European
demand for electric motor products and the negative effect of translating sales
of the Company's Italian operations from the weaker Italian lire to U.S.
dollars. Sales by the Precision Instruments Group also declined as a result of
continued poor market conditions for aerospace products and process and
analytical instruments. A sales improvement was reported by the
 
                                       11

 
Industrial Materials Group due to the strength of demand for liquid filtration
products, specialty metal products and compounded plastics. Sales by all
business segments to foreign markets totalled $202.9 million in 1993 compared
to $233.7 million in 1992, a decrease of 13.2%. Export shipments from the
United States in 1993 were $105.7 million, a decrease of 11.4% from 1992,
primarily as a result of weak economic conditions in Europe.
 
  New orders during 1993 were approximately $703.9 million, a decrease of
$31.6 million or 4.3% from 1992. The backlog of orders was $212.6 million at
year-end, an 11.8% decrease from 1992, reflecting the lower level of business
in the Electro-mechanical and Precision Instruments Groups.
 
  Business segment operating profit before restructuring and other unusual
operating charges was $74.8 million in 1993, compared to $100.1 million in
1992, a decrease of 25.3%. Along with the reduction due to the lower sales
volume, this decline reflects operating inefficiencies (primarily within the
Electro-mechanical and the Precision Instruments Groups) and higher expenses
caused by a plant start-up and plant rearrangements in the Electro-mechanical
Group. In 1993, business segment results also reflect charges totalling $52.1
million for resizing and restructuring certain operations and other unusual
expenses. After reflecting these charges, business segment operating profit
for 1993 was $22.7 million.
 
  Corporate expenses (including unallocated administrative expenses, interest
expense and net other income) were $33.9 million in 1993, substantially
unchanged from $33.3 million in 1992.
 
  The effective rate of income tax benefit for 1993 of 34.5% reflects the new
U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% for all of 1993. The overall
effective rate of the tax benefit was reduced somewhat by a tax provision on
foreign pre-tax earnings.
 
  After-tax earnings for 1993, before restructuring and other unusual charges,
were $26.2 million or $.60 per share. This compares to net income of $44.4
million or $1.01 per share earned in 1992. After restructuring and other
unusual charges totalling $33.5 million (after tax), the Company reported a
net loss of $7.3 million, or $.17 per share for 1993.

  The Electro-mechanical Group's sales decreased $28.8 million or 9.3% to
$280.7 million primarily because of Italian lire currency translation and
because of reduced customer demand for domestically produced electric motor
products during the year. Before currency translation, the Italian operations
reported 2.6% higher sales over 1992. Operating profit of this group decreased
29.8% to $35.0 million due to lower sales volume, higher costs related to new
product introductions, a plant start-up and plant rearrangements, less
favorable product mix and negative foreign currency translation effects.
 
  Precision Instruments Group sales in 1993 were $275.4 million, a decrease of
$21.7 million or 7.3% from 1992. The sales decline reflects the continuing
weakness in demand for aircraft instruments and engine sensors from commercial
airlines and poor conditions in the aerospace industry and in process control
markets. The sales decline was partially offset by increased sales of truck
instruments, flight reference systems and sales by a new business acquired in
the first quarter of 1993. Operating profit of this group before restructuring
and other unusual charges was $17.1 million in 1993 compared to $28.0 million
in 1992, a $10.9 million or 39.0% decline. This decrease was due to the sales
decline, production inefficiencies and changes in product mix. This group's
profits were further reduced by restructuring and unusual operating charges of
$47.8 million in 1993, of which $39.8 million was recorded in the fourth
quarter, and resizing charges of $8 million which were recorded in the first
nine months of the year. These charges were primarily for work force reductions
planned or which occurred in 1993 (including certain pension-related costs),
asset write-downs, product line relocations of certain gauge manufacturing
operations, and consolidation of the Company's aerospace businesses. Most of
these actions were necessary due to the unwillingness of the union at the
Company's Sellersville facility to agree to wage and work rule concessions
requested by the Company necessary to make that operation competitive. After
restructuring and other unusual operating charges, this group reported an
operating loss of $30.6 million for 1993.
 
  Industrial Materials Group sales in 1993 were $176.1 million, an increase of
$13.1 million or 8.1% from 1992 largely due to increased sales of liquid
filtration products, compounded plastics and specialty metal products. Group
operating profit before restructuring and other unusual charges was $22.2
million, a slight improvement over operating profit of $22.1 million reported
for 1992. An increase in profits by the Specialty Metal Products Division was
substantially offset by lower profits from the other businesses in this group
due to operating inefficiencies and changes in product mix at certain
divisions. After fourth quarter 1993 restructuring and other unusual charges of
$3.9 million, primarily for certain asset write-downs, the group operating
profit was $18.3 million for 1993. In February 1994, a warehouse attached to a
plant in this group collapsed under the weight of heavy snow. The plant has
returned to full operation and the damages and related losses are covered by
insurance.
 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1991
 
 Results of Operations
 
  For 1992, Ametek achieved record sales of $769.6 million, exceeding sales in
1991 by $54.5 million or 7.6%. The increase occurred primarily in the Electro-
mechanical Group and was the result of increased worldwide demand for electric
motors, the introduction of new products and increased market penetration.
Sales were also enhanced by the acquisition of an electric motor business in
the first quarter of 1992. A sales increase by the Industrial Materials Group
was more than offset by lower sales by the Precision Instruments Group, which
suffered from a sharp decline in demand for aircraft instruments and engine
sensors in the commercial and military markets. Sales by all business segments
to foreign markets totalled $233.7 million in 1992 compared to $211.8 million
in 1991, an increase of 10.3%. Export sales from the United States totalled
$119.3 million in 1992 compared to $111.6 million in 1991, a 6.9% increase.
 
  New orders during 1992 were approximately $735.5 million, an increase of
$26.2 million, or 3.7% over 1991. The backlog of orders was approximately
$240.9 million at year-end, a 12.4% decrease from the end of 1991, reflecting
the lower level of business in the Precision Instruments Group.
 
 
                                       13

 
  Business segment operating profit was $100.1 million in 1992, an increase of
$11.5 million or 12.9% over last year's $88.6 million. The improved operating
results for 1992 came mainly from the overall higher sales volume in the
Electro-mechanical and Industrial Materials Groups and improved performance by
the Company's three Italian motor divisions.
 
  Corporate expenses (including unallocated administrative expenses, interest
expense and net other income) of $33.3 million in 1992 were $2.9 million lower
than last year's $36.2 million, primarily due to lower interest expense
resulting from the reduced level of debt.
 
  The effective tax rate for 1992 was 33.5% compared to 1991's rate of 27.5%.
Both periods benefitted from favorable income tax adjustments. The 1992 rate
reflects a net favorable settlement of certain tax years for United States
operations, while the 1991 rate included the recognition of tax benefits from
combining certain foreign operations.
 
  Net income was $44.4 million or $1.01 per share for 1992, compared to
earnings of $38.0 million or $.87 per share for 1991.
 
  Net income for the fourth quarter of 1992 was $10.6 million, substantially
unchanged from net income of $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1991,
yielding earnings per share of $.24 for both periods. Lower 1992 fourth-quarter
business segment operating profit in the Precision Instruments Group, and a
higher effective corporate tax rate in 1992's fourth quarter due to a change in
Italian tax law affecting all of 1992, were offset by lower interest expense
and other nonoperating expenses. Sales in the fourth quarter of 1992 reached
$191.5 million, 4.4% ahead of the $183.4 million shipped in the fourth quarter
of 1991, reflecting continuing strong demand for electric motors.
 
 Business Segment Results
 
  Electro-mechanical Group sales in 1992 were $309.6 million, an increase of
$59.8 million or 23.9% from 1991 largely due to improved demand and market
penetration for electric motors aided somewhat by the acquisition of a new
business in the first quarter of 1992. Group operating profit increased 41.1%
to $49.9 million due to the higher sales volume, a more favorable product mix,
and improved operating performance by the Italian motor divisions.
 
  In the Precision Instruments Group, sales were $297.0 million for 1992, a
decrease of $12.9 million or 4.2% from 1991. The sales decline reflects
continuing weak demand for aircraft and aerospace instruments, sensors and
spare parts for commercial airlines and the military, caused by the deepening
recession in this market. The overall sales decline was partially offset by
increased sales of truck instruments. The group's operating profit of $28.0
million fell 14.8% from $32.9 million in 1991, largely because of the steep
sales decline in some of the group's more profitable products.
 
  The Industrial Materials Group's 1992 sales increased $7.5 million or 4.8% to
$163.0 million, due to increased sales of water filtration products and metal
powders. Operating profit of the group totalled $22.1 million in 1992, compared
to $20.3 million in 1991, an 8.7% increase, reflecting the increase in the
group's sales volume and lower operating expenses in the Company's plastics
compounding and foam packaging businesses.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
 Liquidity
 
  Working capital at December 31, 1993 amounted to $134.2 million, a decrease
of $56.0 million from December 31, 1992, caused largely by the provisions for
resizing, restructuring and other unusual items. The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities at December 31, 1993 was 1.80 to 1, compared to 2.38 to 1
at December 31, 1992.
 
                                       14

 
  Cash generated by the Company's operating activities totalled $65.3 million
in 1993 compared to $78.6 million in 1992. The decrease reflects the lower
level of earnings, after adding back $50.9 million of restructuring and other
unusual charges not requiring the use of cash in 1993. Cash flows from
operating activities, less cash used for investing and financing activities of
$83.9 million, resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $18.7
million since the beginning of 1993. Cash used in 1993 included $38.3 million
for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, $25.1 million for the
payment of dividends, $19.4 million for the repayment of long-term debt, $16.6
million for the purchase of a business and investments and $8.9 million for the
purchase of 683,400 shares of the Company's common stock in the second quarter
of 1993. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities
totalled $84.7 million at December 31, 1993, a decrease of $31.0 million from
December 31, 1992.
 
  Of the $54.9 million of resizing, restructuring and other unusual charges
recorded in 1993, certain items require cash expenditures which are expected to
be funded by normal operations. Approximately $4.0 million was expended in
1993, and the Company anticipates that approximately $25.3 million will be
expended over the next two years. After all the restructuring actions are in
place, the Company expects to realize continuing benefits resulting from
reduced labor costs, improved productivity and other lower operating costs
which, the Company believes, should more than offset these cash expenditures
over time. Certain asset write-downs, provisions for pension curtailments and
other unusual items totaling $25.6 million will not require the use of cash, or
incremental cash, during the next five years.
 
  The proceeds of the 9 3/4% senior notes, together with borrowings under the
new bank credit agreement and available cash, will be used (a) to retire (i)
$106.8 million aggregate principal amount of 8.95% notes, (ii) $75.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 9.35% notes and (iii) $3.6 million aggregate
principal amount of 8.05% notes, (b) to repurchase outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $150 million
and (c) to pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the senior notes
and the credit agreement.
 
  The Company's future interest costs are expected to increase because of the
higher outstanding total debt. The Company's quarterly common stock dividend
was recently reduced from $.17 per share to $.06 per share. This reduction,
without giving effect to the intended repurchase of common stock, will result
in an annual saving of approximately $19.4 million. This saving, along with
lower near-term required debt principal payments, should more than offset the
higher interest cost.
 
  The Company believes that the amounts to be available under its new bank
credit agreement and the proceeds of the sale of the senior notes, together
with cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations, will provide
sufficient capital resources to service all debt obligations, fund the share
repurchase program and finance working capital, the new lower dividend and
capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future.
 
 Capital Expenditures
 
  Capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) were $38.3 million during 1993.
The majority of the expenditures were for additional manufacturing equipment
and an additional production facility in the Electro-mechanical Group to
provide expanded production capacity. The 1993 capital spending level is
approximately 60% higher than 1992. The Company expects to continue its high
level of capital spending in 1994, with special emphasis on the Electro-
mechanical Group. The projected 1994 capital expenditures are approximately $37
million, of which $10 million has been rescheduled from 1993.
 
 Acquisitions
 
  On March 31, 1993, the Company purchased certain assets of Revere Aerospace
Inc., a United States subsidiary of Dobson Park Industries PLC, for
approximately $7 million in cash. Revere is a producer of thermocouple and
fiber optic cable assemblies. In 1992, the Company acquired a producer of small
electric
 
                                       15

 
motors and injection-molded components, a United Kingdom industrial filtration
business, an instrument manufacturer located in Germany, and two small product
lines for a total of $11.7 million in cash. The motor company acquisition was a
factor in the Company's recent decision to form the Technical Motor Division in
the Electro-mechanical Group. These acquisitions have complemented the
Company's existing businesses and broadened its global marketing efforts.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
  The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations, as well as
stringent clean-up requirements, and has also been named a potentially
responsible party at several sites which are the subject of government-mandated
clean-ups. Provisions for environmental clean-up at these sites and other sites
were approximately $4.9 million in 1993 ($1.4 million in 1992). While it is not
possible to accurately quantify the potential financial impact of actions
regarding environmental matters, the Company believes that, based upon past
experience and current evaluations, the outcome of these actions is not likely
to have a material adverse effect on future results of operations of the
Company.
 
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED
 
  In November 1992 the FASB issued Statement No. 112 relating to accounting for
postemployment benefits. In March 1993, Statement No. 115 relating to
accounting for marketable securities was issued. The Company has adopted both
of these Statements effective as of January 1, 1994. Adoption of these
accounting standards did not have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations.
 
IMPACT OF INFLATION
 
  The Company attempts to minimize the impact of inflation through cost
reduction programs and by improving productivity. In addition, the Company uses
the LIFO method of accounting for inventories (whereby the cost of products
sold approximates current costs), and therefore, the impact of inflation is
substantially reflected in operating costs. In general, the Company believes
that programs are in place designed to monitor the impact of inflation and to
take necessary steps to minimize its effect on operations.
 
OUTLOOK
 
  The Company is subject to economic uncertainties in its key markets around
the world. However, management believes that the Company will be strengthened
by the restructuring actions taken in 1993 and will benefit from its strategic
plan to build long-term shareholder value. Management believes that the
Company's global businesses and historically strong cash flow combine to
position the Company to deal effectively with these uncertainties.
